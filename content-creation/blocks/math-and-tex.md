You can use mathTeX format to include mathematical formulae in your documentation. We offer that throught the [KaTeX](https://katex.org/docs/supported.html) library.

We also offer this [as inline content](../editor/inline/math-and-tex.md).

### Example of Math & TeX block

$$
s = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N-1} \sum_{i=1}^N (x_i - \overline{x})^2}
$$



### Representation in Markdown

```
