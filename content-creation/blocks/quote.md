# Quote

Quotes are useful when you want to include something from another source.

Start a quote by typing `>` followed by pressing `space` in an empty paragraph, or use the [command palette](./#command-palette) to insert it.

### Example of a quote

> "No human ever steps in the same river twice, for it's not the same river and they are not the same human." — _Heraclitus_

### Representation in Markdown

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```markdown
> "No human ever steps in the same river twice, for it's not the same river and they are not the same human." — _Heraclitus_
```
{% endcode %}
