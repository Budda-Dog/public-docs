# Import

The import function allows you to migrate and unify existing documentation in GitBook. You can choose to import single or multiple pages although limits apply.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
**Permissions**

All members with editor permission or above can use the import feature.
{% endhint %}

## Supported formats

GitBook supports imports from websites or files that are:

* Markdown (.md or .markdown)
* HTML (.html)
* Microsoft Word (.docx).

We also support import from:

* Confluence
* Notion
* GitHub Wiki
* Quip
* Dropbox Paper
* Google Docs

You can also upload a ZIP **** containing HTML or Markdown files when **importing multiple pages.**

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Note: this feature is in beta.**

Feel free to suggest import sources we don't support yet and [let us know](../faq/support.md) if you have any issues.
{% endhint %}

## Import panel

When you create a new space, you'll have the option to import content straight away:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Import.png" alt="A screenshot from the GitBook app. In the editor section is a blank page without any content. There is a button for importing content."><figcaption><p>The new page menu</p></figcaption></figure>

Import a page or subpage by selecting `Import Page` from the New Page menu, or `Import Subpage` in the page action menu, found in the table of contents:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/import gif.gif" alt="An animated gif from the GitBook app. The cursor clicks on the &#x22;Import new pages&#x22; button, and a pop-up appears with the title &#x22;Import your content&#x22;. On the pop-up are buttons for lots of different sources that you can import content from, such as HTML, Markdown, Word, and OpenAPI."><figcaption><p>Import from the page action menu</p></figcaption></figure>

When you choose your input source, instructions will explain how to proceed.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Although GitBook supports importing content from different kinds of sources, the end result might be different from your source due to differences in product features and document format.
{% endhint %}

## Limits

GitBook currently has the following limits for imported content:

* The maximum number of pages that can be uploaded in a single import is **20.**
* The maximum number of files (images etc.) that can be uploaded in a single import is **20.**
