# What is a space?

In GitBook, a space is a project where you can start organizing your ideas. Imagine it as a virtual book where you can start writing pages individually or collaborate asynchronously with your team members.&#x20;

## Create a space

To create a space click on the :heavy\_plus\_sign: button at the bottom of the sidebar.&#x20;

You can also create a space directly from your organization library or a collection screen using the **new space** button:

## Duplicate a space

To duplicate a space, select **duplicate** from the space's menu.

Duplicating a space will create a copy of the source space, in the same location (organization, collection, sub-collection, etc.) as the source space.

For example, duplicating a space called **Design System**, that lives in the Design collection, will be saved as **Copy of Design System**, inside the Design collection. Once duplicated you can edit the name as required.&#x20;

## Move a space

To move a space navigate to the space name in the sidebar, open the triple dot menu, click on **move space to...** and then decide where to move it. Alternatively, simply drag and drop a space in the sidebar to reorder it. \

You can move spaces between collections or even organizations, if you have an [admin role](../../collaboration/invite-members-to-your-organization/roles.md) in both.

## Delete a space

You can delete your space from the space page by clicking the triple dot menu in the top right corner and clicking **delete**. You will need to confirm the deletion in a popup.&#x20;

**Deleted spaces can be restored from trash for up to 7 days**. After that time, they will be permanently deleted.
