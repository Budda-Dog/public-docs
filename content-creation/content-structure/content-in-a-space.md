# Content in a space

## Table of Contents

<div data-full-width="true">

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Table of contents.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>The table of contents in a GitBook space</p></figcaption></figure>

</div>

Each space can contain as many pages as you need to write your documentation. All these pages are visible on the left side of your screen in the **table of contents**.

From the table of contents you can:

* Create new [pages](content-in-a-space.md#pages)
* Create and manage [page groups](content-in-a-space.md#groups)
* Add [external links](content-in-a-space.md#external-links)
* [Import external docs](../import.md) like websites or Markdown files

## Organizing your content

<div data-full-width="true">

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/organizing content.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Pages organized in the table of contents under page groups</p></figcaption></figure>

</div>

There are 4 different types of entries for the table of contents.

<details>

<summary>Initial Page</summary>

The initial page is the homepage or the root of your documentation and works as the main node of all the pages of your documentation.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Pages</summary>

A page has a title, an optional description, and a content area where you can write and add any kind of content.â€Œ

You can nest pages by dragging and dropping a page below an other in the table of contents.

Theoretically, there is no limit to page nesting. But we advise that you avoid adding more than 3 levels of nesting to avoid overly complex structures that might be overwhelming to navigate.

When you change the title of a page, the page's **slug** (the part at the very end of the URL, e.g. `/hello-world`) will automatically update, unless you've already manually set the page's slug.

You can change the title and the slug of a page anytime by clicking on the triple dot icon next to the page title in the table of contents, and then clicking **rename**.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Page Groups</summary>

Page groups are created to bring pages together and for you to create sections of pages dealing with similar subjects.

Groups can only live at the **top level of the table of contents**. You cannot nest groups inside groups.

You can change the title and the slug of a group page anytime by clicking on the triple dot icon next to the group title in the table of content, and then clicking **rename**.

</details>

<details>

<summary>External links</summary>

These entries are external links and do not have any content in the editor. Their main function is to link to external sites or resources.

</details>

## Create a new page

If you're in [live edit](../../collaboration/collaboration/live-edits.md) mode, you'll spot the new page link on the left-hand side under the existing pages in your table of contents. If your space is locked for live edits, you'll first need to start a new [change request](../../collaboration/collaboration/change-requests.md) by clicking the **edit** button near the top right corner of the space.

<div data-full-width="true">

</div>

Once a new page is created you will be able to write rich text and rich content using our [editor](../editor/).

## Create a page group

If you're in live edit mode, can click the **new page** button on the left-hand side under the existing pages in your [table of contents](https://docs.gitbook.com/getting-started/overview#table-of-contents), and then choose **new group**.

<div data-full-width="true">

</div>

## Create external links <a href="#external-links" id="external-links"></a>

If you're in live edit mode, can click the **new page** button on the left-hand side under the existing pages in your table of content, and then choose **new link**.

</div>

## Can't see the option to create a new page?

{% hint style="warning" %}
If [live edits](../../collaboration/collaboration/live-edits.md) are disabled for your space, you will need to create a new (or edit an existing) [change request](../../collaboration/collaboration/change-requests.md). Once you are in a change request, the **new page** button (which allows you to create pages, page groups and links) will be available.
{% endhint %}
