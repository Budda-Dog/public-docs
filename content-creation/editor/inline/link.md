# Link

You can insert three different types of links:

* [Relative links](link.md#relative-links)
* [Absolute links](link.md#absolute-links)
* [Email address `mailto` links](link.md#email-addresses)

## Relative links

Relative links are links created by linking pages that already exist in your content. The advantage of using relative links is that if the page's URL, name, or location changes, its reference will be kept up to date resulting in fewer broken links.

Here's how to insert a relative link:

1. Select some text or click somewhere in your paragraph where you want to insert the link.
2. Wait for the inline palette to appear.
3. Click the inline palette.
4. Start typing the page title.
5. Select the page from the drop down search results.
6. Hit `enter`.

## Absolute links

Absolute links are for external links.

{% hint style="info" %}
External links will always open in a new tab.
{% endhint %}

Here's how to insert an absolute link:

1. Select some text or click somewhere in your paragraph where you want to insert the link.
2. Wait for the inline palette to appear.
3. Click the inline palette.
4. Paste a URL.
5. Hit `enter`.

## Email address mailto links

Email address `mailto` links are useful when you want your visitors to click on a link that will open up their default email client, fill in `TO` with the email address of your link, and allow them to write an email to send out.

Here's how to insert an email address `mailto` link:

1. Select some text or click somewhere in your paragraph where you want to insert the link.
2. Wait for the inline palette to appear.
3. Click the inline palette.
4. Paste or type `mailto:something@address.com`, replacing `something@address.com` with the email address you would like to use.
5. Hit `enter`.
