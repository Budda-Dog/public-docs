# Apps & Integrations Platform

The GitBook **Apps & Integrations** platform lets you connect your GitBook Spaces to your favorite services and platforms.

It contains apps and integrations built by GitBook, and will in the future also include some built by other developers and companies.

### How to install an integration?

You can install an integration in a couple of ways:

* either on a **single Space** right [from the Space screen](install-an-integration.md#installation-on-a-space).
* or on **selected or all Spaces** within your [Personal or Organization library](install-an-integration.md#installation-in-a-library).
