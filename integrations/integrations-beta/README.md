# Integrations (beta)

Welcome to the documentation for upcoming integrations that are currently in closed beta. We’ve been exploring new ways you can leverage technical knowledge in and outside of GitBook — starting with expanding our integrations to include tools you already know and love.

{% hint style="info" %}
The integrations listed in these pages are available exclusively through our closed beta. You’ll need explicit access in order to see and use these integrations in the GitBook app.

You can sign up for early access on [our beta page](https://www.gitbook.com/beta).
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
Has your app changed and you’re not sure why? Someone in your organization upgraded you to our beta. Don’t worry — there’s some great stuff in here that we’re excited for you to try. Read the docs below or head to [our beta page](https://www.gitbook.com/beta) to get up to speed!
