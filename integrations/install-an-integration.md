# Install and manage integrations

You can install an integration in a single space, multiple spaces, or all the spaces across your organization.

If you install an integration in a single space, it will only work in that specific space. By installing an integration in multiple spaces, you’ll be able to perform actions across all those spaces.

### Install an integration in a space

#### 1. Open the Integrations menu

Start by clicking **Integrations** in the space sub-navigation to install an integration on a single space.

#### 2. Review the available integrations

In the **Integrations** menu, you’ll see a list of all the integrations available to install.

#### 3. Select the integration and install

Next, click on the integration you want to install on the space (e.g Slack).

This will open up the integration’s installation screen. Click **Install** to connect it to your space.

#### 4. Complete the configuration

Finally, complete the installation by following the instructions and select the options you need.

You can do this in the integration’s **Organization setup** and **Space setup** sections.

### Install an integration in multiple spaces

To install an integration on more than one space, you can do so from the **Configure** menu for that integration.&#x20;

To open this, click on the **Settings** :gear: cog, choose your organization’s settings, and choose the **Integrations** option in the left sidebar. Then click **Configure** on the integration you want to install, and choose **Manage spaces** in the sidebar of the menu that appears.

You now have two options:

* **Install on all spaces** – This will make the integration available to everyone, in every existing and future space in your organization
* **Manage spaces** – Here you can see individual spaces that this integration has been installed on, add new, configure setups in individual spaces, or uninstall for specific spaces.

**Note:** If you have **Install on all spaces** enabled, you will not see the option to manage the integration on individual spaces.
{% endhint %}

### Manage your organization’s integrations

You can view and manage all of the integrations in the **Integrations** section of your organization on your [organization settings](../account-management/organization-management.md) page. Click **Configure** on any integration to open its settings.

Click **Install Integration** to open up the Integrations menu, which shows a list of all the integrations that you can install. Here, you can[ install an integration in a space](install-an-integration.md#install-an-integration-on-a-space), or install an [integration in multiple spaces. ](install-an-integration.md#install-an-integration-on-multiple-spaces)

### Complete installation configuration

Whether you choose to install an integration on one space or many, you’ll need to run through the configuration options in the **Organization setup** screen to complete the installation.

Depending on the integration in question, you may be able to apply different configuration options for each space. You can do this in the **Space setup** section.&#x20;
