# Legacy pricing

We’ve [updated our pricing model](https://www.gitbook.com/blog/new-site-sections#new-pricing-for-new-users) recently, to accommodate for many of the new features we’ve been releasing for published sites. Because of this, there is a chance you may still be on our old pricing model.

Some of the new features we are releasing are only available on our updated pricing plans. Please [contact support](https://docs.gitbook.com/help-center/support/how-do-i-contact-support) if you would like to learn more and upgrade your pricing.

You can [view our current plans](./) here.

### Updated pricing

We've made some changes to our plans to simplify publishing and better align features with site plans. Here's a summary:

* **Pro Plan**: No longer includes a monthly platform fee. You can purchase and publish sites without restrictions, even on the Free plan.
* **Organization Plan**: Now focused exclusively on collaboration.
