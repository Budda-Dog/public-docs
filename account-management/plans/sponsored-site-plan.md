The Sponsored Site Plan lets you access all of GitBook's top features at no cost while displaying a small, relevant ad in the corner of your documentation site. Each view generates revenue for you, turning your documentation into a source of income.

### Apply for the Sponsored Site Plan

The sponsored site plan is a plan designed specifically for sites. View the steps below to learn how to publish your first sponsored site.

### Create and Publish a Sponsored Site

Begin by creating a new site from the site wizard and setting up your site with content. When asked to choose a plan, head to the “For open source” section, and choose the Sponsored Site plan.
{% endstep %}

### Submit your Site for ad review

Before you’re able to submit your site for review, your site must be published **publicly** for **7 days.** After this, you’ll be able to submit your site for review. Head to the [Public publishing](../../published-documentation/publish-a-docs-site/public-publishing.md) section to learn more.

Head to your site’s settings, and scroll down to the Ads and sponsorship section. From here, review the Ads checklist to make sure your site meets all the requirements before submitting.
{% endstep %}

### Wait for review

After your application is submitted, here's what you can expect:

* **Review Process:** Your site will be reviewed, and you can expect an estimated review time of **up to 7 days**. Please note that this timeline may be different based on processing delays.
* **Final Status Update:** After the review, we’ll update your site’s status. Your site will either be marked as **approved** or **rejected**, depending on the review outcome. If approved, ads will be added to your site!
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

### How It Works

Once your site is live, here’s how the Sponsored Site Plan operates:

* **Earning Potential:** Every time someone views your documentation, a small, relevant ad will be displayed in the bottom corner of each page. You earn money from these views, which you can use to support ongoing development efforts.
* **Ethical Advertising:** At GitBook, we prioritize ethical advertising. Ads displayed on your site will not track or retarget your users, ensuring a respectful experience for your audience.
* **Visibility of Content:** Your content remains the focus. Only one small ad will appear on each page, ensuring that your documentation is always front and center.
