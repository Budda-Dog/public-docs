# Billing and Account Management FAQ

## Trials

The free trial gives you the opportunity to test GitBook's features, start onboarding your team, and create your content. Please feel free to [reach out to our team](../../help/support.md) with any questions you have during this period!

### How do I start a free trial?

When you create a GitBook account, your organization will start out on our free **Personal** plan. Simply [invite one or more team members](../member-management/) to your organization and a 14-day free trial of our **Plus** plan will begin!

<details>

<summary>Do I have to provide a payment method to start a free trial?</summary>

No! We do not ask for any payment information during your free trial. If you decide to upgrade after your trial, we will ask for a payment method at that point.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How can I check the time remaining on my free trial?</summary>

Click on the settings ![](../../.gitbook/assets/settings.png) icon, which is located at the bottom of the sidebar, then click on **\[organization name] settings**. This will take you to the general tab of that organization's settings page. From there, click on the **plans** tab. You will see a banner on the plans page that tells you how many days remain on your free trial.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Which features can I test during the free trial?</summary>

You can test all of the features of the **Plus** plan. Please take a look at [our pricing page](https://www.gitbook.com/pricing) to compare all of the features of our plans.

</details>

<details>

<summary>What happens at the end of my free trial?</summary>

After the trial, the Plus plan will be cancelled and the organization will be downgraded to our free Personal plan. This means that all Plus features will be disabled, as will any additional users that you have invited to the organization. An upgrade will be required if you would like to restore those additional features or users.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Can I extend my free trial?</summary>

If you have a **large organization** and you are interested in the **Pro** or **Enterprise** plan, we'd love to offer you some more time to onboard your team! ðŸ˜Š Please get in touch via [sales@gitbook.com](mailto:sales@gitbook.com) and we'll go through some requirements.

## Billing

### What payment methods do you accept?

We use Stripe's localized payment methods in an effort to support the most common payment methods for our users globally. You will be able to view the options supported in your geography in the checkout flow when you upgrade your account. Credit cards (Visa, Amex, Mastercard) are supported across all geographies.

### Can I change my billing method to invoicing?

Payment by invoice is currently only available on our Enterprise plan. All other plans must be paid by credit card or other localized payment methods offered by Stripe.

### Why is there a platform fee in the Pro plan?

The **monthly** platform fee gives you access to many features that aren't available on the Free and Plus plans (like SAML SSO and Visitor Authentication). It also allows us to keep the per-user price lower so that it's easier to scale knowledge sharing across your team. If you're not sure about choosing the Pro plan, we designed the Free and Plus plans to make it easy and affordable to get started with GitBook and only upgrade when you are ready.

The platform fee is flat, which means it _doesn't_ go up as you add more users to your organization.

### When I invite a new member to my GitBook organization, when will I be charged?

GitBook's pricing is based on the number of members in an organization, and our [pro rata billing policy](billing-policy.md) helps to ensure that you pay for the correct usage. For monthly plans, you can add or remove members at any time and the change to your bill will be included on your next monthly invoice. For yearly plans, the same applies â€” however, if your pending charges exceed a certain amount, we'll invoice straight away. (There are more details on the specifics of that in our [billing policy](billing-policy.md).)

{% hint style="warning" %}
It is important to note that you _**won't**_ go through _**another checkout process**_ when adding a new member to your organization.
{% endhint %}

### **Are users with guest or reader permissions paid?**

Yes, guests or readers are fully paid users. The permissions help you manage access to your content but do not affect the price. \
\
Please note this refers to readers added to your organization (i.e. those visible when you navigate to Settings and then Members) rather than readers on your public docs which are not chargeable.&#x20;

### **Do you provide annual pricing/contracts?**

GitBook offers monthly and yearly plans. You can find out more on [our pricing page](https://www.gitbook.com/pricing).

### I have paid for the yearly plan. Why did I receive another invoice?

This happens when you have added extra users since subscribing to an annual plan. Each user (regardless of their permission level) is considered a paid seat. \
\
Read more about how we work out the outstanding fees in our [billing policy](billing-policy.md).

### Can I get a refund?

As per our [terms of service](https://policies.gitbook.com/terms), we do not offer refunds. However, if you believe you have been charged in error, please [contact the support team](../../help/support.md).

### Does GitBook offer a discount for non-profit/open-source organizations?

We don't offer a discount, but we _do_ offer two options:

1. Our free **Personal** plan should suit many non-profit/open-source organizations.
2. For any organizations that need to collaborate on their docs with others _and_ who meet [our criteria](../plans/apply-for-the-non-profit-open-source-plan.md), we offer an **OSS** plan. [Click here for more information](../plans/apply-for-the-non-profit-open-source-plan.md).

### Do you offer any discounts?

You can get 2 months free by subscribing to our annual plan! We do not offer any other discounts at this time.

### Can I amend my billing information?

Yes, you can! To do that, please head to the organization settings page, and then click on the billing tab. From there, you can amend the billing details.

Please ensure your billing information is correct _before_ you pay for a subscription. \
We are unable to change details on already paid invoices.

### Can I receive my receipts via email?

GitBook's billing is powered by Stripe, and you can access and download invoices directly from the billing tab in your organization's settings. You can update your details any time there as well.

### If I subscribe to a paid plan, can I remove the "Powered by GitBook" link from my published documentation?

No, removing the "Powered by GitBook" link is not an option that we provide.
