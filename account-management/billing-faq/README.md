# Billing FAQ

### Why is there a platform fee in the Pro plan?

The **monthly** platform fee gives you access to many features that aren't available on the Free and Plus plans (like SAML SSO and Visitor Authentication). It also allows us to keep the per user price lower so that it's easier to scale knowledge sharing across your team. If you're not sure, we designed the Free and Plus plans to make it easy and affordable to get started with GitBook and only upgrade when you see the need to.

The platform fee is flat, which means it doesn't go up as you add more users to your organization.

### Can I get a refund?

As per our [terms of service](https://policies.gitbook.com/terms#3.-billing-schedule-no-refunds) we do not offer refunds.&#x20;

Annual subscriptions grace period: if you contact us within 24h of your auto renewal, we will be happy to refund your payment and cancel your subscription. Any requests send after that period will not be processed as per above.&#x20;

### Can I amend my billing information?

Please ensure your billing information is correct _before_ you pay for your subscription. We are unable to change details on already paid invoices. To ensure your billing information is exactly how you would like to see it on the invoice please navigate to the billing tab in organization settings and update your information before subscribing to a plan.&#x20;

### Can I change my billing method to invoicing?

Payment by invoice is currently only available on our Enterprise plan. All other plans must be paid be credit card or other localised payment methods offered by Stripe.

### I have paid for annual plan. Why did I receive another invoice?&#x20;

This happens when you have added extra users since subscribing to an annual plan. Each user regardless of their permission level is considered a paid seat. Read more about how we work out the outstanding fees in our [billing policy](billing-policy.md).&#x20;

### Do you offer any discounts?

You can get 2 months free by subscribing to our annual plan! We do not offer any other discounts at the moment

### **Do you provide annual pricing/contracts?**

GitBook offers monthly and yearly plans. You can find out more on [our pricing page](https://www.gitbook.com/pricing).

### Can I receive my receipts via email?

GitBook's billing is powered by Stripe, and you can access and download invoices directly from the billing tab in your organization's settings. You can update your details any time there as well.

### What payment methods do you accept?

We use Stripe's localised payment methods in an effort to support the most common payment methods for our users globally. You will be able to view the options supported in your geography in the checkout flow when you upgrade your account. Credit cards (Visa, Amex, Mastercard) are supported across all geographies.&#x20;
