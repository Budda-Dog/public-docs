# Invite members to your organization

There are a couple of ways you can invite new members to your organisation:

* Generating an invite link and sharing it directly.
* Inviting them directly using their email address.

**Don't forget** — inviting additional members to your organization will immediately impact the price of your subscription. Take a look at our [billing policy](../billing-faq/billing-policy.md) for the details.

## Managing invite links

Invite links in GitBook allow you to maintain a list of links that members can use to sign up and quickly join your organization.

Invite links are tied to specific [roles](roles.md) – and you can create (and revoke!) as many invite links as you like.

## Inviting members directly

You can directly invite members in the members section of your organization settings. Enter their email(s), select their default role, and click **continue**. Each member will receive an email that will allow them to sign up to GitBook and instantly join your organization.

## Removing members

### Leaving an organization

You can leave an organization by going to the organization's settings page, and clicking on **leave organization** at the bottom of the page. Note that it will not be possible to rejoin the organization unless you are invited to it again.

### Removing a member

Organization admins can remove a member of a team through the members list in the members section of the organization settings.
