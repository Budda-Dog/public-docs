# Teams

## Creating and managing teams

You can create, edit and remove teams in the **Teams** section of your organization settings. To find this, click the cog in the bottom-left of your window. Choose organization settings for your desired organization, then click the Teams option in the sidebar.

On this page, you can view and search your current teams, or click one to open the team details page and see more information about it and its members.&#x20;

## Managing team members

You can manage team members in two ways:

1. Click on a specific member in **Members & permissions** to open their member page, and selecting the **Teams** tab. Click the vertical ellipsis and you can remove them from the team immediately, or choose **Manage team**.
2. In the **Teams** section, click on the number of members in the list to open the team details page.  You can then use multi-select on the member list to select and remove team member, or add more with the button at the top.
