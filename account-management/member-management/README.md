# Member management

You can [invite and remove members](invite-members-to-your-organization.md) from your organization, manage members' content access through [roles](roles.md), and manage [teams](teams.md) of members from the members' page in your organization's settings.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Permissions**

**Admins** can invite and remove members, change members' roles, and manage teams. **Creators** can manage permissions at a content level (collection or space).\
**Team owners** can manage members of the team they have ownership of.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

## Members & permissions

Shows each person’s role, last seen date, and [SSO](../../product-tour/sso-and-saml/sso-and-saml.md) status, if applicable. You’ll also see an overview of the [spaces](../../content-creation/content-structure/what-is-a-space.md) they can access and, if you’re on the Pro plan, how many [teams](teams.md) they’re part of.&#x20;

There is a search bar at the top, and for each member you can see their role, their last seen date, and the number of teams they are in and spaces they can access."><figcaption><p>In the Members &#x26; permissions section, you can see all the members and guests in your organization, as well as information about their activity and permissions.</p></figcaption></figure>

</div>

Click the **Teams** or **Access** listings for any member to jump to a list of all those teams and spaces.

You can also click on any member to open their **individual member page**. Here, you can see more information about them, including their join date and active status.&#x20;

Select the **Teams** and **Spaces** tabs to see a list of the [teams](teams.md) they’re a member of, and the spaces they have access to — as well as their access level for those specific spaces.
