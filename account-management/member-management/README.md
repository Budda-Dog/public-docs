# Member management

You can [invite and remove members](invite-members-to-your-organization.md) from your organization, change members' [roles](roles.md) and [permissions](permissions-and-inheritance.md), and manage [teams](teams.md) of members from the members page in your organization's settings.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Permissions**

Admins can invite and remove members, change members' roles and permissions and manage teams. Creators can manage permissions at a content level.
{% endhint %}
