## **How can I reset my password?**

## Why do you need my phone number?

To create and confirm your account, you may be requested to verify your phone number with a verification code sent on your mobile phone.

This extra security step has been set up for several reasons, but the most important one is to limit spam and scam content on GitBook. Unfortunately, malicious users and bots are trying to use GitBook to host unauthorized content. To limit this behavior, you may need to verify that you are a real human.

Your phone number will only be used for this authentication step and you will never receive any further communication on this channel.

## What browsers are supported by GitBook?

GitBook supports the current versions of [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/), [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.org/firefox/), [Safari](http://www.apple.com/safari/), and [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/microsoft-edge).

## Does GitBook support RTL languages?

We have RTL support in mind, but it's not yet ready. For now, only paragraphs and headings will automatically detect RTL text and adapt its layout. Lists and other content blocks are not aligned properly. Also, you may have noticed a poor font quality being used for your language.
