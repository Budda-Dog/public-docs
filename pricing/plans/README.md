# Plans

When you create your personal account on GitBook your account is on the **free Personal plan**. It offers up to 10 private or public spaces. It is great for personal projects, hosting your notes, or even commercial use where you don't need to collaborate with other folks.

For companies and organizations where you need to collaborate with others please check out our pricing plans below.

## Our pricing plans

The [**Team**](./#team-plan) plan is our most popular plan. It offers an advanced workflow, comments, versioning, unlimited public or private content, powerful search, import external content and usage analytics.
