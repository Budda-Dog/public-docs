# PDF export

GitBook supports multiple methods of exporting to PDF:

* export your entire space
* export a single page
* export a page and all of its subpages

{% hint style="info" %}
**Good to know: **You can as well export your space in markdown via the [Github](../integrations/git-sync/) sync and/or export your space to a [zip.file](../accounts/export-or-delete-your-data.md).
{% endhint %}

## Export settings

Choose if you like to allow **readers to download a PDF** **copy** of your content in the features section under advanced features in the customization page of your space publish panel.
