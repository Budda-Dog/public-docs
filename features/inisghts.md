# Insights

You can measure and improve your documentation by checking how your pages are performing and which keywords are used when searching through your documentation.

GitBook measures your traffic per page, and displays the number of page views per page over the course of the selected timespan. You can select from daily, weekly, or monthly traffic. A bar chart is displayed, plotting the traffic over time.

In the 'search' tab within the insights panel, you can view the search terms that have been most popular in your space. You can use this information to inform your content architecture, and consider making certain parts of your docs more easy to find without search.

Each insights view will let you download the data as a CSV for your own use and analysis.

## More insightful page view insights

GitBook default insights offers a quick overview of page views, to take a deeper look into your readers behavior, you should take a look at our [Google Analytics](broken-reference) integration.

## **Data sampling**

In data analysis, sampling is the practice of analyzing a subset of all data in order to uncover the meaningful information in the larger data set. For example, if you wanted to estimate the number of trees in a 100-acre area where the distribution of trees was fairly uniform, you could count the number of trees in 1 acre and multiply by 100, or count the trees in a half acre and multiply by 200 to get an accurate representation of the entire 100 acres.

**GitBook Insights** applies session sampling to your data in order to give you accurate reports in a timely fashion. The direct consequences is no page views shown for new spaces or spaces with a low number of page views.
