# Import

GitBook supports **imports from websites or files that are Markdown** (.md or .markdown), HTML (.html), Microsoft Word (.docx).

You can also upload a ZIP containing HTML or Markdown files when importing multiple pages.

We also support import from Confluence, Notion, GitHub Wiki, Quip, Dropbox Paper, and Google Docs.

## Import panel

When you create a new space, you'll have the option to import content straight away:

![](<../.gitbook/assets/Blank Space.png>)

Import a page or sub page by selecting `Import Page` from the New Page menu, or `Import Subpage` in the page action menu, found in the table of contents:

![](<../.gitbook/assets/Page Menu.png>)

When you choose your input source, instructions will explain how to proceed.

**Heads up!** Although GitBook supports importing content from different kind of sources, the end result might be different from your source due to differences in product features and document format.
