# Billing settings

You can manage and see the details of your current subscription in your organization's settings by clicking on the billing tab.

This will redirect you to the billing dashboard for your organization, where you can manage your billing details and download any invoices for previous payments.

**Good to know:** All billing is handled through Stripe. GitBook doesn't store any sensitive payment information, and you can manage all your billing information through the billing dashboard.
