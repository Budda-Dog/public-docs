# Organization plans

**We have just introduced new and improved pricing plans! Please head to** [**the pricing page on our website**](https://www.gitbook.com/pricing) **for all the details.**

If you're subscribed to one of our legacy pricing plans, you can:

* Remain subscribed to the legacy plan; or
* Switch to one of our new and improved pricing plans. If you choose this option, it will _not_ be possible to revert back to a legacy pricing plan later.
