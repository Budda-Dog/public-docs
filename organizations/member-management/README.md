# Member management

One of the best ways to explore collaboration in GitBook is by inviting members to your organization and [creating teams](https://docs.gitbook.com/collaboration/team-management/teams).

## Invite members to your organization

There are a number of ways you can invite new members to your organisation:

* Generating an invite link and sharing it directly
* Inviting them directly using their email address

### Managing invite links

Invite links in GitBook allow you to maintain a list of links that members can use to sign up and quickly join your organization.

Invite links are tied to specific [roles](roles.md) â€“ and you can create (and revoke!) as many invite links as you like.

### Inviting members directly

You can directly invite members in the Members section of your organization settings. Enter their email(s), select their default role, and hit 'Send Invites' and you're good to go. Each member will receive an email that will allow them to sign up to GitBook and instantly join your organization.

## Remove members

Teams change all the time, sometimes there are new members joining ðŸ¤— and some of them go. ðŸ˜¢

### Leave an organization

You can leave an organization by clicking on your `organization's settings > Leave organization.`

### Remove a member

Organization admins can remove a member of a team through the members list in the Members section of the organization settings.
