## Adding a logo and naming your organization <a href="#your-organizations-information" id="your-organizations-information"></a>

![](<../.gitbook/assets/General Settings.png>)

When creating an organization you will be asked to name it and to select a logo. You can also add one later on or change it by:

* Going into your organization and clicking settings on top right hand side of the screen
* Clicking on the âš™ symbol at the bottom of your control panel

Once you are in the tab `general` you will be able to adjust those settings accordingly.

This is also how you can update your organization's name.

## Members

![](../.gitbook/assets/Members.png)

Members tab allows you to add contributors to your team and manage their [permissions level](https://app.gitbook.com/s/-Mb26BMpld-VdvMRsm4j/collaboration/permissions-and-inheritance). You can also remove them.

Teams allows you to create specific teams to manage permissions on more granular level in each space. For example creating an engineering team and giving them exclusive access to engineering spaces. Read more about them in [teams](https://app.gitbook.com/s/-Mb26BMpld-VdvMRsm4j/collaboration/team-management/teams).
