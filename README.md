# What is GitBook?

![](.gitbook/assets/Space.png)

**GitBook** is a modern documentation platform where teams can document everything from products to internal knowledge-bases and APIs.

We want to help **teams to work more efficiently** by creating a simple but yet powerful service for them to **share their knowledge**.

Our mission is to make a **user-friendly** and **collaborative** product for everyone to create, edit and share knowledge through documentation.

## With GitBook you can:

**Collaborate** **asynchronously** with your team to create beautiful documentation and internal knowledge bases.

**Share** **your knowledge** publicly or privately with anyone, or use a secret **link** to allow non-GitBook users to access your private content.
