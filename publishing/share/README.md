# Share your content

GitBook has different sharing options for you to choose from, depending on who you want to be able to access your content.

You can make your content completely [public](space-publishing.md#public-space) to anyone on the internet. Or, you can share more securely using [share links](share-links.md) or [visitor authentication](space-publishing.md#visitor-authentication).

You can also use collection publishing to [publish different versions of your documentation](collection-publishing.md#how-to-publish-a-collection-of-variants). For example, you might want to publish your documentation in different languages, or you might want to publish documentation for each version of your product.
