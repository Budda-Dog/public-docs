# PDF export

The PDF export is available with a **Pro** or **Enterprise** plan. It allows:

1. Visitors to your published content to download the space as a PDF file.
2. You and other logged-in users to export a single page, a page with its subpages, or an entire space as a PDF file.

**Permissions**

Admins and creators can enable and disable PDF export for a space.
{% endhint %}

## Allow readers to export a PDF version of your content

To enable or disable PDF export for your readers, head to the customization settings for a space or collection. On the configure tab, you can enable or disable the PDF export setting. This setting determines whether or not **readers of your published content can download it in PDF format**.

## Export your own content as PDF

Regardless of the configured customization setting shown above, members of an organization (on the Pro or Enterprise plan) who are logged in to the app can export a page, or an entire space as a PDF file.
