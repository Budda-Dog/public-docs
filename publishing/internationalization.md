# Match the UI to the language of your content

GitBook supports the internationalization of a space or a collection, enabling public documentation user interface elements to be translated.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Permissions**

Administrators and creators can change the language of the user interface for public documentation.
{% endhint %}

## Choosing a language for your content

Currently, the supported languages are English, French, Spanish, Chinese (simplified), and Japanese.

By default, your content will have the **English** language selected. To change this, click **customize** in the [space sub-navigation](https://docs.gitbook.com/getting-started/overview#space-sub-navigation), go to the **configure** tab, and use the dropdown menu in the **localize user interface** setting.

<div data-full-width="true">

The configure tab has been selected, and the dropdown for the localize user interface setting has been expanded. It shows 5 language options: English, French, Spanish, Chinese (simplified), and Japanese."><figcaption><p>Choose your preferred language for the user interface elements of your published documentation</p></figcaption></figure>

</div>

### Inheriting language settings

If a space is inside a collection, you can set the localization language for that space to inherit. This will keep the space's localization language in sync with the setting at the collection level. Choosing a different language for one space inside a collection would override the collection-level setting.

## Publishing your content in different languages

If you would like to [share a different language (or product) version](share/collection-publishing.md), you will have to publish a collection as a variant. This enables you to create a space per language and publish the collection as a unified UI, allowing readers to switch seamlessly between different language spaces.
