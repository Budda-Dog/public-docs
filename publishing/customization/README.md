# Customization

You can customize the appearance of your public content, [localize your user interface](space-customization.md#localize-user-interface), and manage public content integrations and features such as [Google Analytics](space-customization.md#google-analytics), [PDF export](../share/pdf-export.md) and [page ratings](space-customization.md#page-rating).

You can customize at the space or collection level. Customizing a collection allows you to set top-level customizations that spaces within the collection can inherit.
