# Customization

You can customize the appearance of your public content, match the user interface to the language of your content, and manage public content integrations and features such as [Google Analytics](space-customization.md#google-analytics), [PDF export](../share/pdf-export.md) and [page ratings](space-customization.md#page-rating).

Customization can be applied at a space or a collection level.  Customizing a collection allows you to set top-level customizations that spaces within the collection can inherit.
