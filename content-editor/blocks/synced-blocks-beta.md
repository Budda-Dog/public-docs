# Synced blocks (beta)

Synced blocks allow you to insert reusable content into your docs. See the overview page for [Synced Blocks](../../synced-blocks/synced-blocks-beta.md) for more info.

### **Insert a synced block**

You can insert a synced block as you would with any other block. Hit `/` on an empty line to open the **Insert palette** and choose **Synced block**. Alternatively, click the `+` on the left of any block or empty line.&#x20;

You can choose the synced block you want to add from the list, or search for the one you need.

### **Detach a synced block**

You can detach a synced block by opening the **Action menu** <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Actions menu.png" alt="" data-size="line"> and selecting **Detach instance**. Detaching an instance of a synced block will only detach it in the current page.

Once detached, any changes you make to the block(s) will not be reflected across the other instances, and changes you make in those instances will not be reflected in the detached block(s).
