# Unordered lists

Unordered lists are great for making a series of points that do not necessarily need to be made in a particular order.

### Example of unordered list

* Item
  * Nested item
    * Another nested item
  * Yet another nested item
* Another item
* Yet another item

{% hint style="info" %}
To create nested items, you can use `tab` to indent and `shift` + `tab` to outdent.
{% endhint %}

### Representation in Markdown

```markdown
- Item
   - Nested item
      - Another nested item
   - Yet another nested item
- Another item
- Yet another item
```
