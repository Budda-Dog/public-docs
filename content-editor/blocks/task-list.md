# Task lists

Task lists allow you to create a list of items with checkboxes that you can check or uncheck. This is useful for tracking project items, shopping lists, creating playbooks and more.

### Example of a task list

- [ ] Here’s a task that hasn’t been done
  - [x] Here’s a subtask that has been done, indented using `tab`.
  - [ ] Here’s a subtask that hasn’t been done.
- [ ] Finally, an item, unindented using `shift` + `tab`.

### Representation in markdown

```markdown
- [ ] Here’s a task that hasn’t been done
  - [x] Here’s a subtask that has been done, indented using `tab`
  - [ ] Here’s a subtask that hasn’t been done.
- [ ] Finally, an item, unidented using `shift` + `tab`.
```

{% hint style="info" %}
Please note that readers of your published space will not be able to check or uncheck these boxes. You decide which boxes are checked and unchecked when you write the content.
{% endhint %}
