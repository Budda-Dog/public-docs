# Embedded URLs

To add an embedbed URL, simply paste the link of the content you want to embed and hit `Enter`!&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** The content you want to embed must be publicly available in order for GitBook to access the file. For example, when embedding a Google doc the share settings must be set to _Anyone with the link_.
{% endhint %}

Here are a few examples of the kind of content you can embed into GitBook — and there are many more!

### Videos

{% embed url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_uLM5i0Z4c" %}

### Codepen

{% embed url="https://codepen.io/davidkpiano/pen/wMqXea" %}

### Spotify

{% embed url="https://open.spotify.com/track/4FmiciU3ZmfgABlbCSXcWw?si=65zMAhStT2ivTit-kZISWg" %}

### Git Sync representation in Markdown

```markdown
{% raw %}
{% embed url="URL_HERE" %}
{% endraw %}
```
