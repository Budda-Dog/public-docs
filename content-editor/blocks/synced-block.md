# Synced block

Synced blocks allow you to turn a selected or selection of blocks into a reusable block.

### Create a synced block

To create a synced block, [select one or more blocks](./#selecting-blocks-and-interacting-with-selected-blocks), click the action menu, and choose "Turn into a synced block".

### Update a synced block

You can update a synced block from any instance your synced block appears. Simply click into the block or select "edit" while the block is selected, and edit either the title or body of your synced block.

#### In an un-published space

Edits to a synced block in un-published space will go live across it's instances when the changes are finished. A modal will appear asking for confirmation when the changes are finished.

#### In a change request

Editing a synced block inside of a change request will not update across it's instances until the change request is merged.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Changes made to synced blocks included in published content will **automatically update in the published site**.

Keep this in mind as you update synced blocks across your instances.
{% endhint %}

### Detach a synced block

You can detach a synced block by clicking the action menu, and selecting "Detach instance".

Detaching an instance of a synced block will only detach it in the current page.
