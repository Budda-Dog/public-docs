# Searching content

Whether you’re working within the GitBook app or your visitors are reading your published content, GitBook’s search functions help to make it quicker and easier to find what you’re looking for. Powered by GitBook AI, the answers to your questions are now more helpful than ever.

**Permissions**\
For **published content**, anyone can use the built-in **search** feature in the top-right of the screen to find the answers or pages they’re looking for.

For **internal content,** all member roles can use the **quick find** search bar in the top-left of the screen. However, members will only be able to search the internal content they have permission to access.‌ This includes private content, which is only searchable by you.
