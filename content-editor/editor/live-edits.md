# Live edits

**Live editing** is the default editing mode for any newly-created GitBook space. A space in live edit mode is editable by anyone with the [right permissions](../../account-management/member-management/roles.md).

With live editing enabled, you can see the avatars of anyone currently viewing the space in the top-right corner.&#x20;

GitBook supports live collaboration, meaning you’ll be able to work on the same document with multiple members at the same time.

## Toggling live edit mode

You can toggle live edit mode in a space by selecting **Lock live edits** or **Unlock live edits** from the space’s Actions menu <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Actions menu.png" alt="Three vertical dots" data-size="line">.

### When is live editing _not_ available?

You cannot unlock live editing if:

1. a space is [published](../../published-documentation/overview.md) with the **In collection**, **Public**, or **Unlisted** [visibility option](../../published-documentation/share/space-publishing.md). We know this is a limitation, and we hope to change this in the future.
2. [GitHub or GitLab Sync](../../integrations/git-sync/) is enabled.

{% hint style="info" %}
Only users with the **admin** or **creator** [roles](../../account-management/member-management/roles.md) can lock or unlock live edits.
{% endhint %}
