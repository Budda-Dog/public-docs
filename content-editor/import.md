# Import

The import function allows you to migrate and unify existing documentation in GitBook. You can choose to import single or multiple pages — although some limits apply.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Permissions**\
Only users with [editor permissions or higher](../account-management/member-management/roles.md) can edit pages.
{% endhint %}

### Supported import formats

GitBook supports imports from websites or files in the follow formats:

* Markdown (.md or .markdown)
* HTML (.html)
* Microsoft Word (.docx)

We also support imports from:

* Confluence
* Notion
* GitHub Wiki
* Quip
* Dropbox Paper
* Google Docs

To **import multiple pages** you can upload a ZIP containing HTML or Markdown files.

### The Import panel

When you create a new [space](editor/content-structure/what-is-a-space.md), you’ll have the option to import content from the bottom sheet of the first empty page:

Alternatively, you can always import a page or subpage by selecting **New page** > **Import new pages** in the [table of contents](editor/navigation.md#table-of-contents), or opening the Actions menu <img src="../.gitbook/assets/Actions menu.png" alt="" data-size="line"> for a page and choosing **Import subpages**.

<div data-full-width="false">

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/import-button (2).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>There are two ways to import content into GitBook.</p></figcaption></figure>

</div>

After choosing an input source, you can select the file you’d like to import.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Although GitBook supports importing content from different sources, the end result may be different from your source due to differences in product features and document formats.
{% endhint %}

### Limitations

GitBook currently has the following limits for imported content:

* The maximum number of pages that can be uploaded in a single import is **20**.
* The maximum number of files (images etc.) that can be uploaded in a single import is **20**.
