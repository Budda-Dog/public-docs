# SCIM & directory sync

Directory sync allows you to automatically provision/deprovision users and teams from your company directory into your GitBook organization.

As users join your directory, they will be created and added to your GitBook organization.

You can also have teams in GitBook synchronize to your directory groups, and have all user memberships synchronize automatically.

{% hint style="warning" %}
SCIM/Directory sync is not currently publicly available in GitBook.

It's possible to set up directory sync with user and team provisioning via [the GitBook API](https://developer.gitbook.com/api/resources/organizations/members).

You can read more about how to set up directory sync using the API here:[guide-directory-sync-using-the-gitbook-api.md](guide-directory-sync-using-the-gitbook-api.md "mention")

If you have further questions, please [get in touch](mailto:sales@gitbook.com).
