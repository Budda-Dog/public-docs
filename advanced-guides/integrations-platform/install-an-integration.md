# Install an integration

Integrations can be installed in a single space, or in a number of spaces within an organization.

## Installation on a space

Start by clicking on integrations in the space sub-navigation to install an integration on a single space.

This will bring you to the **apps & integrations** screen, which shows a list of all the integrations available to install.&#x20;

Next, click on the integration (e.g Slack) you want to install on the space.

This will open up the integration's installation screen. Next, click the **install** button on the right-hand side of the screen.&#x20;

This installs the integration and connects it to your space.

### Complete the configuration

Finally, you need to follow the instructions, and select the options you need, to **complete the installation**.

This can be done in the integration's installation configuration screen shown to you, specifically in the **configuration** and **space configuration** sections.

## Installation in a library

You can also install an integration on **selected or all spaces** in your library.&#x20;

* First, go to your personal account settings or organization settings screen.
* Next, click the apps & integrations tab under your settings.

This will show the apps & integrations settings for your organization.

From there, you can access the configuration of the already installed integrations in your organization. Click the install integration button on the top right-hand side to install an integration.

This will open up the apps & integrations screen showing a listing of all the integrations available to install. From there the process is the same as installing an integration in a single space.&#x20;

Once complete you can then choose to:

### Option 1 - Install on all spaces

To connect the integration to all spaces in the library, toggle **install on all spaces** in the **space access** section:

This will automatically install it on all spaces and applies to current and future spaces.

### Option 2 - Install on selected spaces

To connect the integration on selected spaces, click the **pick a space** dropdown in the **space configuration** section:

Then, select a specific space from the dropdown options and click the **add to space** button to install the integration on the space.

**Repeat** the above for **each of the spaces** you want to connect to the integration.

### Complete the configuration

Next, regardless of the option you chose, you will need to select the needed configuration options in both the configuration and space configuration sections of the installation screen to complete the installation.

You can apply different configuration options to each space. This can be done in the **space configuration** section. Use the space dropdown on the top right-hand corner to switch to another space:
