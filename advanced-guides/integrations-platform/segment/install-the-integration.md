# Install the integration

To start using the Segment integration, you will need to install it in your GitBook library or just on a single space. To do this, follow the steps described in the [install an integration](../install-an-integration.md) section.

Once it is installed, you will need to connect it to your chosen Segment source **to complete the installation**. To do this, continue on to the next steps: [configure the integration](configure-the-integration.md).
