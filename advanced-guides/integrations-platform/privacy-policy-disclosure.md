# Privacy Policy disclosure

In some situations, you may wish to make your readers aware of your privacy policy. This is particularly important if you're using GitBook's [Google Analytics Integration](../../features/broken-reference/) to track your users. GitBook lets you link to your own privacy policy in a cookie consent dialog.

Here's how to link to your privacy policy in the cookie consent dialog.

2. In the Integrations section, use the toggle to enable the Privacy Policy feature and enter the link to your Privacy Policy.
3. Save changes and voil√†!
