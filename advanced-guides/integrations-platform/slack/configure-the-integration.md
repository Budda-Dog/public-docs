# Configure the integration

After installing the integration to your space or GitBook library, you will first need to authorize the Slack integration to connect to your Slack workspace.

In the **configuration** section of the integration's configuration screen, click the **authorize** button.

This will open up a pop-up window requesting permission for the GitBook Slack app to access your Slack workspace.

Next, make sure to select the correct Slack workspace from the dropdown menu located at the top right-hand side of the pop-up.&#x20;

Then, click the **allow** button to grant the permission and complete the authorization flow:

This will bring you back to the integration's configuration screen if the authorization was successful.

After successful authorization, the [GitBook Slack app](https://gitbook.slack.com/apps/A7DE1QCTD-gitbook?tab=more\_info) will be automatically installed in your Slack workspace.
{% endhint %}

Next, you have the option to select the default Slack channel to which the integrations will be posting messages to, when no channel is selected individually for each spaces.

Click the **default channel** dropdown in the **configuration** section and select the default channel from the dropdown options.

Next, you can select different configuration options to apply individually to each of the spaces. You can do this in the **space configuration** section.

You can for example select a specific Slack channel to which the integration will be posting the selected space updates.

Additionally, you can choose what type of space updates will trigger the delivery of messages to the selected Slack channel.

To switch to another space and configure its individual configuration options, click the **space dropdown** at the top right-hand corner and select the specific space:
