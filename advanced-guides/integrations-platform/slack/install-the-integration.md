# Install the integration

To start using the Slack integration, you will need to install it in your GitBook library or just on a single space. To do this, follow the steps described in the [install an integration](../install-an-integration.md) section.

Once it is installed, you will need to connect it to your Slack workspace, select the channels to which the integration will be posting the status updates, and tweak other configuration options to your need, **to complete the installation**. To do this, continue on to the next steps: [configure the integration](configure-the-integration.md).
