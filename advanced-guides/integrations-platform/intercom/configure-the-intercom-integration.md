# Configure the Intercom integration

## Install the integration

To start using the Intercom integration, you will need to install it in your GitBook library or just on a single space. To do this, follow the steps described in the [install an integration](../install-an-integration.md) section.

Once it is installed, you will need to connect it to your Intercom account **to complete the installation.**

## Configure the integration

After installing the integration to your space or GitBook library, you will first need to authorize the Google Analytics integration to connect to your Google Analytics account.

<summary>Step 2: Grant the GitBook app access to your Google Analytics account</summary>

This will open up a pop-up window requesting permission for the GitBook app to access your Google Analytics account.

Make sure that you're logged in with the correct Google Analytics account. You can see which account you are logged in with under the **allow access** button.

Then, click the **allow access** button to grant permission and complete the authorization flow.

This will bring you back to the integration's configuration screen if the authorization was successful.
