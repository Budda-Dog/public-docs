# Install an integration

You can install an integration in a couple of ways:

* either on a **single Space** right [from the Space screen](install-an-integration.md#installation-on-a-space).
* or on **selected or all Spaces** within your [Personal or Organization library](install-an-integration.md#installation-in-a-library).

## Installation on a Space

To install an integration on a **single Space**, the easiest way is to head to **your Space** in the editor.

Next, click the **Integrations** tab in the Space's sub-navigation bar:

![Installation from a Space](<../../.gitbook/assets/Space Integrations Tab.png>)

This will bring you to the **Apps & Integrations** screen showing a listing of all the integrations available to install.&#x20;

Next, click on the card of the integration (e.g Slack) you want to install on the Space:

![Integrations Listing](<../../.gitbook/assets/Integrations Listing.png>)

This will open up the integration's installation screen. Next, click the **Install** button at the top right hand side of the screen:

![Integration's Installation Screen](<../../.gitbook/assets/Integration Installation Screen.png>)

This installs the integration and connects it to your Space.

### Complete the configuration

Finally, you need to follow the instructions, and select the options you need, to **complete the installation**.

This can be done in the integration's installation configuration screen shown to you, specifically in the **Configuration** and **Space Configuration** sections:

![Integration's Installation Configuration](<../../.gitbook/assets/Integration Installation Configuration.png>)

## Installation in a library

You can install an integration on **selected or all Spaces** in your **Personal** or **Organization** library.

To do this, first go to your [Personal account settings](../../billing-and-admin/settings/account-settings.md) or [Organization settings screen](../../billing-and-admin/settings/organization-management.md).

Next, click **Apps & Integrations** tab under your Organization's settings group in the sidebar (or at the top of the sidebar for your Personal library):

![Installation in an Organization](<../../.gitbook/assets/Installation in Organization.png>)

This will show the **Apps & Integrations** settings for your **Organization.**

From there, you can access the configuration of the integrations that are already installed in your Organization.

To install an integration, click the **Install integration** button on the top right hand side:

![Apps & Integrations settings for an Organization](<../../.gitbook/assets/Install Integration Organization.png>)

This will open up the **Apps & Integrations** screen showing a listing of all the integrations available to install.&#x20;

Next, click on the card of the integration (e.g Slack) you want to install on the Space:

![Integrations Listing](<../../.gitbook/assets/Integrations Listing (1).png>)

This will open up the integration's installation screen. Then, click the **Install** button at the top right hand side of the screen. This installs the integration in your Organization's library.&#x20;

You can then choose to:

### Option 1 - Install on all Spaces

To connect the integration to all Spaces in the library, toggle **Install on all spaces** in the **Space access** section:

![Install Integrations on all Spaces](<../../.gitbook/assets/Install on all Spaces.png>)

This will automatically install it on all spaces and applies to current and future spaces.

### Option 2 - Install on selected Spaces

To connect the integration on selected Spaces, click the **Pick a space** dropdown in the **Space configuration** section:

![Install on Selected Spaces](<../../.gitbook/assets/Install on selected Spaces.png>)

Then, select a specific Space from the dropdown options and click the **Add to Space** button to install the integration on the Space:

![Add to Space](<../../.gitbook/assets/Add Integration to Space.png>)

**Repeat** the above for **each of the Spaces** you want to connect to the integration.

### Complete the configuration

Next regardless of the option you chose, you will need to select the needed configuration options in both **Configuration** and **Space Configuration** sections of the installation screen to **complete the installation**.

You can apply different configuration options to each Spaces. This can be done in the **Space configuration** section. Use the Space dropdown on the top right hand corner to switch to another Space:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Space configuration (1).png>)
