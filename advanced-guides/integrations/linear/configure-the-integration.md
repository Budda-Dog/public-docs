# Configure the integration

## Install the integration

To start using the Linear integration, you will need to install it in your GitBook library or just on a single space. To do this, follow the steps described in the [install an integration](../install-an-integration.md) section.

Once it is installed, you will need to connect it to your Linear workspace **to complete the installation.**

## Configure the integration

After installing the integration to your space or GitBook library, you will first need to authorize the Linear integration to connect to your Linear workspace.

<summary>Step 2: Grant the GitBook Linear app access to your Linear workspace</summary>

This will open up a pop-up window requesting permission for the GitBook app to access your Linear workspace.

Make sure that you're logged into the correct Linear workspace.

Then, click the **allow access** button to grant permission and complete the authorization flow.

This will bring you back to the integration's configuration screen if the authorization was successful.
