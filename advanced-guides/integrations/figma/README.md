# Figma

## Get Started

To get started, you will need to install the Figma integration in GitBook and configure it to your needs. For this, follow the steps described in these sections:

* **Step 1:** [install the integration](../install-an-integration.md)
* **Step 2:** [configure the integration](configure-the-figma-integration.md)

## Feature Overview

Once you've installed the Figma integration, embedding Figma files into GitBook is simple. Just paste a Figma link into the GitBook editor. The app will turn the link into an embed that shows the Figma file name along with an image snapshot of what the file looked like at the moment that you embedded it.

When viewing an embed, click on the maximize button to preview the file in GitBook or on the file or artboard name to open it in Figma.
