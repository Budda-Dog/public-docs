# Searching your content

Whether you’re working within the GitBook app or your visitors are reading your published content, GitBook’s search functions (now powered by our GitBook AI feature, Lens ✨) help to make it quicker and easier to find what you’re looking for.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Permissions**\
For **published content**, anyone can use the built-in **search** feature in the top-right of the screen to find the answers or pages they’re looking for.

For **internal content,** all member roles can use the **quick find** search bar in the top-left of the screen. However, members will only be able to search the internal content they have permission to access.‌ This includes private content, which is only searchable by you.
{% endhint %}
