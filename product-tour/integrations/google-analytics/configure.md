## Install the integration

To start using the Google Analytics integration, you will need to install it in your GitBook library or just on a single space. To do this, follow the steps described in the [install an integration](../install-an-integration.md) section.

Once it is installed, you will need to enter your Google tag ID **to complete the installation.**

## Configure the integration

After installing the integration to your space or GitBook library, you will need to choose which spaces it is installed on, and then enter your Google tag ID.
