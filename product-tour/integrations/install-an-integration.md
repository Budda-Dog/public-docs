# Install an integration

Integrations can be installed in a single space, or in a number of spaces within an organization.

An integration installed in a single space will only work in that specific space, while an integration installed in multiple spaces will be able to perform actions across all selected spaces.&#x20;

## Installation on a space&#x20;

### Complete the configuration

Finally, you need to follow the instructions and select the options you need to **complete the installation**.

This can be done in the integration's installation configuration screen shown to you, specifically in the **configuration** and **space configuration** sections.

## Installation on multiple spaces

You can install an integration on **selected or all spaces** in your library.&#x20;

* First, go to your personal account settings or organization settings screen.
* Next, click the apps & integrations tab under your settings.

This will show the Integrations settings for your organization. You will be able to review already installed integrations and access their configuration, as well as install any new integrations.

Click the **install integration** button on the top right-hand side to install an integration.

This will open up the apps & integrations screen showing a list of all the integrations available to install. From there the process is the same as installing an integration in a single space.&#x20;

Once complete you can choose to either enable the integration on all spaces or install it on selected spaces.&#x20;

### Install on all spaces

To connect the integration to all spaces in the library, toggle **install on all spaces** in the **space access** section:

This will automatically install it on all spaces and applies to current and future spaces.

### Install on selected spaces

To connect the integration on selected spaces, click the **pick a space** dropdown in the **space configuration** section:

Then, select a specific space from the dropdown options and click the **add to space** button to install the integration on the space.

**Repeat** the above for **each of the spaces** you want to connect to the integration.

### Complete the configuration

Next, regardless of the option you chose, you will need to select the needed configuration options in both the configuration and space configuration sections of the installation screen to complete the installation.

You can apply different configuration options to each space. This can be done in the **space configuration** section. Use the space dropdown on the top right-hand corner to switch to another space:
