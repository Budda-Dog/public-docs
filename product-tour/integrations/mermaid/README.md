# Mermaid

## Get Started

To get started, you will need to install the Mermaid integration in GitBook and configure it to your needs. For this, follow the steps described in these sections:

* **Step 1:** [install the integration](../install-an-integration.md)
* **Step 2:** [configure the integration](../segment/configure-the-segment-integration.md)

## Feature Overview

Once the Mermaid integration is installed, a new Mermaid block will become available in the GitBook editor. You can insert a Mermaid block into any page. Within the block you can edit the code content and preview how the diagram looks using the live editor.

When using the GitHub or GitLab integrations, all code blocks with the `mermaid` syntax will be replaced by diagram. All diagrams inserted from the editor will be formatted as such code blocks in Markdown.
