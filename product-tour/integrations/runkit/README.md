# RunKit

## Get Started

To get started, you will need to install the RunKit integration in GitBook and configure it to your needs. For this, follow the steps described in these sections:

* **Step 1:** [install the integration](../install-an-integration.md)
* **Step 2:** [configure the integration](configure.md)

## Feature Overview

RunKit notebooks are interactive JavaScript playgrounds connected to a complete Node environment right in your browser. They make it easy for your users to run sample code right from your documentation.

Once the RunKit integration is installed, a new RunKit block will become available in the GitBook editor. Adding RunKit notebooks in your GitBook documentation is simple - select the RunKit block from the [Command palette](https://docs.gitbook.com/tour/editor/blocks#command-palette) and insert your code snippet. Or paste the link to an existing RunKit notebook into the GitBook editor to embed it in your page.
