<summary>Step 2: Grant the GitBook app access to your Jira account</summary>

This will open up a pop-up window requesting permission for the GitBook app to access your Figma account.

Make sure that you're logged in with the correct Jira account. You can see which account you are logged in with under the **allow access** button.

Then, click the **allow access** button to grant permission and complete the authorization flow.

This will bring you back to the integration's configuration screen if the authorization was successful.
