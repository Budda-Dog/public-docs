### Feature Overview

Fathom Analytics is a no cookie analytics platform which you can enable with a single line of code. The GitBook Fathom Analytics integration allows you to track traffic in your published spaces from your Fathom dashboard.

Automatic tracking in your documentation: each of your connected GitBook spaces will fetch the light-weight Fathom tracking script and inject it in your public content.
