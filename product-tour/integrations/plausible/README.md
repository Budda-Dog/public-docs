# Plausible

## Get Started

To get started, you will need to install the Plausible integration in GitBook and configure it to your needs. For this, follow the steps described in these sections:

* **Step 1:** [install the integration](../install-an-integration.md)
* **Step 2:** [configure the integration](configure-the-plausible-integration.md)

## Feature Overview

The GitBook Plausible Analytics integration allows you to track traffic in your published spaces from your Plausible dashboard. Automatic tracking in your documentation: each of your connected GitBook spaces will fetch the cookie-less Plausible tracking script and inject it in your public content.
