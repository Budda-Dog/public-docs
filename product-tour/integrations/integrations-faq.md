# Integrations FAQ

## Can I build my own integration?

We're hard at work to open our Integrations Platform to the public. The Integrations Platform includes a **REST API**, a framework for building **custom blocks**, and added functionality for **Visitor Authentication** and **Dynamic Documentation.**

We're currently working on building features for the platform, and are looking for interested developers to help us test what we've been working on. If you're interested in trying out the Integrations Platform, let us know [here](https://survey.refiner.io/e61q1m-dgr4km).

## Can I customize GitBook using CSS, JavaScript or other programming languages?

Right now, it is not possible to customize your GitBook as you may have seen or heard about in the past. In an earlier and open-sourced version of GitBook this was possible, but with the current version, this functionality was removed.

You can read more about the launch of GitBook 3.0 [here](https://blog.gitbook.com/product-updates/gitbook-3.0-document-everything-from-start-to-ship).

We'd like to make GitBook fit into your current workflows, whether you're using Python, Java, Docker, React, or something entirely differentâ€”We're currently exploring new ways to allow you to customize your GitBook experience further (including the use of the Integrations Platform mentioned above), while giving you a similar experience you might have had with our previous plugin ecosystem or `book.json` workflow.

## What happened to GitBook's CLI tool?

GitBook's CLI tool is not currently supported in the latest version of the GitBook platform. Most of the features previously supported by the CLI are now supported by our [GitBook<>GitHub integration](../git-sync/).
