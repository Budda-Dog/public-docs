# Search & Quick find

GitBook’s **Quick find** palette lets you search for content across all your organizations, and jump between them fast.

### Use Quick find

**​**You can open the **Quick find** palette by hitting the **Quick find** <picture><source srcset="../../.gitbook/assets/quick-find-1.svg" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/quick-find.svg" alt=""></picture> button at the top of the sidebar or by pressing **⌘ + K** on Mac or **Ctrl + K** on PC.

### Search results <a href="#display-of-results" id="display-of-results"></a>

Results from the space you’re currently in appear at the top, followed by results from other spaces from the organization you’re currently working in — **as well as other organizations** you are a member of.

When you select a search result from an organization, you’ll switch to browsing that organization. To go back, use quick find to select a document in the organization you were in before, or use [the organization switcher](../../resources/gitbook-ui.md#the-sidebar) in the sidebar.

{% hint style="info" %}
We do not currently support the ability to prioritize certain content in Quick find results.

### Permissions <a href="#team-permissions" id="team-permissions"></a>

**Quick find** is compliant with your team’s permission settings, meaning that users will only be able to search the content they have permission to access.‌

### Content indexing <a href="#indexation" id="indexation"></a>

We index your content by grouping it into sections. Sections are denoted using [H1, H2 or H3 Headings](../blocks/heading.md), with the content that follows them forming part a section.

Each result shows the first three lines of information below the section header. If your section is too big,  your keyword match may not appear in the preview — but don’t worry, quick find still found a match!
