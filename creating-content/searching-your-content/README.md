Whether you’re working within the GitBook app or your visitors are reading your published content, GitBook’s search functions help to make it easy to find what you’re looking for.&#x20;

You can use quick find to look for specific words or phrases, or you can ask GitBook AI a question. It’ll scan through your docs and summarize an answer in seconds, with references to help you find out more.
