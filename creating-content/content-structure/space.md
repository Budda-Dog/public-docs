# Spaces

A space is a project that lets you work on a collection of related pages. They allow you to write content, organize pages, add integrations and more.

### Create a space

Click the **+** button next to the **Spaces** header in the sidebar and choose **New space** to create a new space. You can also create a new space inside a [collection](collection.md).

You can edit a space’s name by hovering over the name in the [space header](../../resources/gitbook-ui/#space-header).

### Duplicate a space

To duplicate a space, open that space's **Action menu** <picture><source srcset="../../.gitbook/assets/actions_icon_dark.svg" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/actions_icon_light.svg" alt="The Actions menu icon in GitBook"></picture> in the sidebar and select **Duplicate**.

Duplicating a space will create a copy of the source space, in the same location (organization, collection, sub-collection, etc.).

### Move a space

You can move a space by opening the space’s **Action menu** <picture><source srcset="../../.gitbook/assets/actions_icon_dark.svg" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/actions_icon_light.svg" alt="The Actions menu icon in GitBook"></picture> in the sidebar, selecting **Move space to…** and choosing a destination. Alternatively, you can drag and drop spaces in the sidebar to move or reorder them.\

You can move spaces between collections within the same organization, as long as you have an [admin role](../../account-management/member-management/roles.md).

### Delete a space

You can delete a space by opening the space’s **Action menu** <picture><source srcset="../../.gitbook/assets/actions_icon_dark.svg" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/actions_icon_light.svg" alt="The Actions menu icon in GitBook"></picture> in the sidebar and selecting **Delete**.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Deleted spaces can be restored from the Trash for up to 7 days**. After this, they will be permanently deleted.
