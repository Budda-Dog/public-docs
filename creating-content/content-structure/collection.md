# Collections

Collections are a way to group spaces together to make it easier for you to organize your content. With collections, you can:

* organize your content by similar topics or ideas
* manage space [permissions](../../account-management/member-management/permissions-and-inheritance.md) at scale by allowing you to override the organization-level defaults.

### Create a collection

Click the **+** button next to the **Spaces** header in the sidebar to create a new collection. You can also create a collection or space within another collection from the collection’s main page.

### Move a collection

You can move a collection by opening the **Actions menu** <picture><source srcset="../../.gitbook/assets/actions - dark.svg" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/actions.svg" alt=""></picture>, selecting **Move collection to…** and choosing a destination. Alternatively, you can drag and drop collections in the sidebar to move or reorder them.\
\
You can move collections into other collections — or even to other organizations, if you have an [admin role](../../account-management/member-management/roles.md) in both.

### Nested collections

You can nest collections inside each other, creating a collection -> sub-collection -> space hierarchy.

Open a collection and you can click **New collection** from the collection’s main page to create a sub-collection.

To move one collection into another, click **Move collection to…** from the collection’s **Action menu** <picture><source srcset="../../.gitbook/assets/actions - dark.svg" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/actions.svg" alt=""></picture> and then choose its new location. Alternatively, you can drag and drop the collection to its new location.

### How to delete a collection

You can delete a collection by opening its **Actions menu** <picture><source srcset="../../.gitbook/assets/actions - dark.svg" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/actions.svg" alt=""></picture> and selecting **Delete**.

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Deleting a collection is final**, but spaces inside a deleted collection will move to the **Trash** and can be restored up to seven days after deletion. You can access the Trash from the bottom of the sidebar.
