# Custom domains

Every GitBook plan comes with support for custom domains, so that you can make your documentation accessible from your own subdomains (e.g. `docs.example.com`)

{% hint style="info" %}
üîê All spaces served on custom domains automatically benefit from Cloudflare's CDN and an SSL certificate issued by DigiCert.
{% endhint %}

When setting up a custom domain, **it's important to follow the steps in the correct order** to avoid running into any errors along the way.

1. [Choose a subdomain](choose-a-subdomain.md)
2. [Configure DNS](dns-configuration.md)
3. [Set the custom domain in GitBook](custom-domain-setup-on-gitbook.md)
