# How do I contact support?

There are two ways to get in touch with us:

1. You can email [support@gitbook.com](mailto:support@gitbook.com) directly.
2. You can submit a support request via the GitBook app. When you're logged in, click on the **cog icon** near the bottom-left corner of the app. Click **Help & Feedback** and then click **Contact support**.

## What information should I share?

To help _us_ help _you_ as efficiently as possible, please be sure to send us all relevant details:

* If your support request relates to a specific space, please make sure to include a link to it.
* Please describe the steps that you are taking, what happens when you take those steps, and what you expected to happen instead.
* If you are running into an error message, please pass along the error message in full.
* Can you send us a screenshot to show us what you're seeing? Or, can you send us a short video to show us the steps that you are taking? These are extremely helpful!

## When will I get a response?

We aim to respond to every message within 1 business day. At busy times this might not be possible, but we'll always get back to you as soon as we are able!

## Why has the support widget changed?

We've made some internal changes to help us improve the support that we offer. As part of these changes, we have moved to a new help desk system. The main differences you'll notice are:

1. We have a new form in the GitBook app to use when sending us a support request.
2. Responses from our team will always come to you via email, rather than within a widget in the GitBook app.

We found that using an in-app widget could be misleading; some users expected real-time support via this widget, which isn't something that we can currently provide. Now, you can continue working in GitBook or move on to other things while you wait for a response from our team. When we've replied, your inbox will notify you!
