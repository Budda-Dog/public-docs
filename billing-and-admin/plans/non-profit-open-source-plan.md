# Non-profit/open source plan

{% hint style="info" %}
Please note that most of your needs should be covered by our free **Personal** account so, if you don’t plan to collaborate with others, please start there. It allows you to publish content to the world 🌍! It even supports linking a [custom domain](../../advanced-guides/custom-domain/) to each of your spaces.
{% endhint %}

If it's absolutely necessary to collaborate with others, please continue reading.

## Conditions

We welcome applications from organizations that hold a valid charitable status 501(c) or similar as well as open-source applications with a GitHub or GitLab related project.

**Please read the criteria before applying.**
