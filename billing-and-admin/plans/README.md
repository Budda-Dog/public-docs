# Organization plans

An organization is a part of the way that content is structured on GitBook. Every organization has a library containing any number of collections and/or spaces, a free or paid plan, and one or more [members](../../tour/member-management/).

****Only administrators can access an organization's billing settings.
{% endhint %}

## What plans does GitBook offer?

**We have recently introduced new and improved pricing plans! Please head to** [**the pricing page on our website**](https://www.gitbook.com/pricing) **to review the features of each plan.**

In short, we offer:

* A free **Personal** plan, capped at one user, which is ideal for open source developers who want essential features to scale public projects.
* A **Plus** plan, which is ideal for small teams that want to collaborate and document publicly.
* A **Pro** plan, which is ideal for multi-role teams who want advanced publishing and collaboration options.
* An **Enterprise** plan, which is ideal for teams of 20+ with more security and compliance needs.

<summary>Does GitBook offer a discount for non-profit / open source organizations?</summary>

We don't offer a discount, but we _do_ offer two options:

1. Our free **Personal** plan should suit many non-profit / open source organizations.
2. For any organizations who need to collaborate on their docs with others _and_ who meet [our criteria](non-profit-open-source-plan.md), we offer a **Community** plan. [Click here for more information](non-profit-open-source-plan.md).

### Legacy plans

If you're subscribed to one of our legacy (**Team** or **Business**) plans, you have two options. You can:

1. Remain subscribed to the legacy plan; or
2. Switch to one of our new and improved pricing plans. If you choose this option, it will _not_ be possible to revert back to a legacy pricing plan later.

You can find the [full feature comparison](https://www.gitbook.com/pricing) for the new plans on our site, but here is a convenient comparison between the legacy and the new plans:

#### Team vs Plus

| Difference                  | Team | Plus                                |
| --------------------------- | ---- | ----------------------------------- |
| Publish a space as unlisted | Yes  | No (moved to the Pro plan)          |
| Advanced customization      | Yes  | No (moved to the Pro plan)          |
| Minimum charge for 5 users  | Yes  | No (unlimited users, pay as you go) |

#### Business vs Pro

| Difference                                                                                                      | Business | Pro                                 |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------- |
| [Visitor authentication](../../advanced-guides/advanced-sharing-and-security/visitor-authentication.md) feature | No       | Yes (up to 100 sessions per month)  |
| Minimum charge for 20 users                                                                                     | Yes      | No (unlimited users, pay as you go) |
| Flat [platform fee](./#platform-fee) of $99 per month                                                           | No       | Yes                                 |

### Platform fee

The platform fee allows us to scale the resource demanding features that are available on the **Pro** plan and are not available on the **Personal** or **Plus** plans. It also allows us to keep the per user price lower and remove the minimum charge so that it's easier to scale knowledge sharing across your team.

The platform fee is flat, which means it doesn't go up as you add more users to your organization.
