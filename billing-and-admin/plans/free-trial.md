# Free trial

## What is the 14-day free trial?

The free trial gives you the opportunity to test GitBook's features, start onboarding your team and create your content. Please feel free to [reach out to our team](../../troubleshooting/support.md) with any questions you have during this period!

## How do I start a free trial?

When you create a GitBook account, your organization will start out on our free **Personal** plan. Simply [invite one or more team members](../../tour/member-management/) to your organization and a 14-day free trial of our **Plus** plan will begin!

<summary>Do I have to provide a payment method to start a free trial?</summary>

No! We do not ask for any payment information during your free trial. If you decide to upgrade after your trial, we will ask for a payment method at that point.

After the trial, the Plus plan will be cancelled and the organization will be downgraded to our free Personal plan.

An upgrade will be required if you would like to restore those additional features or users.
