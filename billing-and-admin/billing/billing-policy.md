# Billing policy

## 14-day trial‌ <a href="#14-day-trial" id="14-day-trial"></a>

During the trial period you can test all features on the Plus plan. Visit our [pricing page](https://www.gitbook.com/pricing) to compare all plans and features.&#x20;

You can start inviting your team and creating your content. We'll be around to answer any product questions you have.

{% hint style="warning" %}
At the end of your trial (similar to other software) your organization will be reverted to our free plan, and any members you invited to collaborate with you will be frozen.&#x20;

To keep access to features on our paid plans, including collaborating with other team members, you will need to upgrade your organization to one of our paid plans.
{% endhint %}

## **​Fair billing** <a href="#fair-billing" id="fair-billing"></a>

GitBook tries to offer the fairest billing policy by adapting the billing to your usage. In short:‌

* You’ll be charged for members in your organization on the day that you upgrade to a paid plan.
* Any changes to the number of members will be reflected in your monthly or yearly statement, either as extra [prorated charges](pro-rata.md) or payback.

{% hint style="info" %}
The current accepted payment method is credit card.
{% endhint %}

### ​Credit card charges <a href="#credit-card-charges" id="credit-card-charges"></a>

The day you upgrade to a paid plan is the start of your billing period. From here, there are only three different times you will see charges from GitBook:‌

* On the **day you upgraded** to a paid plan.
* On the **monthly or yearly renewal date** of your billing period. (charges apply when adding more members)

{% hint style="warning" %}
Annual and monthly commitments are subject to our [pro-rata pricing](pro-rata.md).
{% endhint %}
