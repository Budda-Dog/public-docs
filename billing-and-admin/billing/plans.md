# Organization plans

**We have just introduced new and improved pricing plans! Please head to** [**the pricing page on our website**](https://www.gitbook.com/pricing) **for all the details.**

If you're subscribed to one of our legacy pricing plans, you can:

* Remain subscribed to the legacy plan; or
* Switch to one of our new and improved pricing plans. If you choose this option, it will _not_ be possible to revert back to a legacy pricing plan later.

### Legacy plan differences

You should be able to see the [full feature comparison](https://www.gitbook.com/pricing) on our site, but here is a convenient comparison between the legacy and the new plans:

#### Team vs Plus

| Difference                  | Team | Plus                                |
| --------------------------- | ---- | ----------------------------------- |
| Publish a space as Unlisted | Yes  | No (moved to the Pro plan)          |
| Advanced customization      | Yes  | No (moved to the Pro plan)          |
| Minimum charge for 5 users  | Yes  | No (unlimited users, pay as you go) |

#### Business vs Pro

| Difference                                                                                                      | Business | Pro                                 |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------- |
| [Visitor Authentication](../../advanced-guides/advanced-sharing-and-security/visitor-authentication.md) feature | No       | Yes (up to 100 sessions per month)  |
| Minimum charge for 20 users                                                                                     | Yes      | No (unlimited users, pay as you go) |
| Flat [platform fee](plans.md#platform-fee) of $99 per month                                                     | No       | Yes                                 |

### Platform fee

The platform fee allows us to scale the resource demanding features that are available on the Pro plan and are not availble on the Free or Plus plans. It also allows us to keep the per user price lower and remove the minimum charge so that it's easier to scale knowledge sharing across your team.

The platform fee is flat, which means it doesn't go up as you add more users to your organization.
