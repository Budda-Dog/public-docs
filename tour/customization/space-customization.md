# Space customization

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Customize (2).png>)

Customizing your space lets you control the branding, presentation and extra features of your space's public content.

{% hint style="info" %}
Most customization settings apply to your **public content**. This keeps your writing experience and in-app GitBook content consistent, while allowing you to control the output to a degree.
{% endhint %}

## Presentation

Presentation customizations let you tweak how your space's basics will appear publicly:

### Published title & icon

You can override the icon and title that your visitors will see when they access your public content. This lets you give your space an 'internal' (in-app) title and an 'external', or public title. The same applies to the space's icon.

{% hint style="info" %}
It's quite common to use longer, or more specific, titles in published content. Changing your presentation settings allows you to do so, without worrying about having long, idiosyncratic space titles in the GitBook app.
{% endhint %}

### Localize user interface

_Customize > Configure_

You can select from a list of languages to localize the user interface of your public content. This will apply translations to the **non-custom** areas of your public content interface. It won't do anything spicy like auto-translate your actual content, but if you're writing a space in a certain language, it's always good to have the surrounding UI reflect that.

{% hint style="info" %}
We're constantly making efforts to support further localized languages. [Give us a shout](https://www.gitbook.com/contact/contact-support) if you have a suggestion.
{% endhint %}

## Collection inheritance

_Customize > General_

Collection inheritance allows a space to inherit its customizations directly from its parent collection. This is useful if you want to control multiple spaces' customizations in one place, and removes the need to make the same change multiple times across spaces.

## Logos and social

_Customize > Basic_

You can upload a custom social preview image for your space. This will set the space's `og:image` to your uploaded image, and it'll show when the space's link is shared to any platform or product that supports OpenGraph images.

You can also replace the space's title entirely with a custom logo. This lets you keep your brand running through your docs.

{% hint style="info" %}
Changing the space's logo will replace the icon **and** the title of the space with the entered logo. If you want to keep the space title visible, you can upload a square logo as the space's [published icon](space-customization.md#published-title-and-icon).
{% endhint %}

## Theming

_Customize > Customization_

Theming lets you customize the primary color, heading theme, and font family of your public content.

{% hint style="info" %}
When theming, you'll be able to see a preview of any changes you make. This can be useful when deciding e.g. which header theme or primary color you want to use.
{% endhint %}

### Primary color

The primary color of your public content will be applied to things like links, hover states, and buttons. This color change will only apply to your **published** content.

{% hint style="info" %}
Accessibility is important! While you can set your primary color to pretty much anything you like, try to keep things accessible and choose a color that'll have good contrast when used as a text link.
{% endhint %}

### Heading theme

You can choose between a number of heading themes for your public content:

The **None** theme will show no header, instead placing the space's icon and title (or logo, if you've overwritten it) in the table of contents. This is great for minimal docs, or docs where you don't need a persistent header.

The **Light** header theme will show a white header and dark text.

The **Bold** header theme will set the header background to your primary color, and show light-colored text.

The **Dark** header theme will show a dark header, with light text.

### Font family

You can customize the font family of your public content from a list of predefined options.

{% hint style="info" %}
GitBook doesn't support uploading or linking of custom fonts. If you think we're missing a typeface that works wonderfully for headers, body copy, and captions, [give us a shout](https://www.gitbook.com/contact/contact-support).
{% endhint %}

## Header links

_Customize > Configure > Header links_

You can add links to your header, with each link having a URL and a text label. This is useful if you want to link to specific parts of your documentation, or back to pages of your main site, directly in the header of your docs.

## Public content integrations

_Customize > Integrations_

### Google Analytics

Enable Google Analytics and enter your Google Analytics tracking ID to start tracking public content events. You can also enable private event tracking, which will send in-app analytics to your specified Google Analytics.

### Intercom

To enable Intercom in your public content, turn it on in customization, and set your Intercom Application ID. You can then configure any Intercom widgets you wish to use in your Intercom settings.

## Public content features

_Customize > Configure_

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Privacy Policy.png>)

You can enable a number of features for your public content, depending on what plan you're on.

### PDF Export

PDF Export allows your readers to export your space as a PDF.

### Page rating

Page rating allows your readers to give simple feedback on any pages of your space, and will show a feedback section at the bottom of each page. You can track the feedback results in the Activity section of the space.

### Privacy policy

Enabling the privacy policy option lets you override the privacy policy link in the public content cookie banner.
