# Image

You can insert inline images to your content. By default, their size is proportional to the font size as their main purpose is to be inserted in line to your content. This is great for badges and icons.‌

There are 3 different sizes of inline images:‌

1. **Inline size:** the default one proportionally sized to the font.
2. **Original size:** will remain inline but with its original size with a maximum width.
3. **Convert to block:** this turns an inline image into a [block image](../blocks/insert-images.md) with its original size.

You can switch the size of an inline image by clicking on the image to open the formatting palette, and then choosing one of the options above.
{% endhint %}
