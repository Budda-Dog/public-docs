# Heading

GitBook offers 3 levels of headings, [which should be enough to properly structure your content](https://practicaltypography.com/headings.html). Headings structure your documents. Heading levels 1 and 2 will appear in the page outline.

All headings have anchor links, which are links that you can use to point to a particular section of your documentation.

You can see the anchors of a title when your content is in read mode. If you want to make some text point to an anchor within a page in your space, you can add a [relative link](../rich-text.md#relative-links).

{% hint style="info" %}
**Good to know:** Reading on a screen is less comfortable than reading on paper. Make sure your content is not too long with too many titles. Sometimes splitting your content into different pages creates a better overview! ðŸ¤“
{% endhint %}
