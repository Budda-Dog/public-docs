# Task list

Task lists allow you to create a list of items with checkboxes that you can check or uncheck. This is useful for tracking project items, shopping lists, create playbooks and more.

### Example

* [ ] &#x20;Here's a task that hasn't been done
  * [x] And here's a subtask that has been done, indented using `tab`.
  * [ ] Aaaaand, here's a subtask that hasn't been done.
* [ ] Finally, an item, unidented using `shift` + `tab`.
