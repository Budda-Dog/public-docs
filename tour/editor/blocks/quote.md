# Quote

Quotes are useful when you want to quote something from another source.

Start a quote by typing `>` followed by hitting `space` in an empty paragraph or use the [command palette](./#command-palette) to insert it.

### Example

> "No human ever steps in the same river twice, for it's not the same river and they are not the same human." — _Heraclitus_

### Git sync representation in markdown

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```markdown
> "No human ever steps in the same river twice, for it's not the same river and they are not the same human." — _Heraclitus_
```
{% endcode %}
