# Paragraph

A paragraph is the most basic content block you can use on GitBook. It's what it says, a paragraph of text.

### Example

Professionally printed material in English typically does not indent the first paragraph, but indents those that follow. For example, Robert Bringhurst states that we should "Set opening paragraphs flush left."

### Git sync representation in markdown

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```markdown
Professionally printed material in English typically does not indent the first paragraph, but indents those that follow. For example, Robert Bringhurst states that we should "Set opening paragraphs flush left."
```
{% endcode %}
