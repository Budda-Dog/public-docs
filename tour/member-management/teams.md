# Teams

Teams are a great way of grouping members within your organization.

## Creating and managing teams

You can create, edit and remove teams in the Members section of your organization settings.

## Managing team members

You can manage team members in two ways:

First, by selecting the team and choosing 'edit team members'.

Secondly, by accessing the member directly, and choosing their teams from the team dropdown.

Both of these options will give you the ability to add or remove members to/from any teams in your organization.
