# PDF export

PDF export is a beta feature, available with a **Pro** or **Enterprise** plan. It allows:

1. Visitors to your published content to download the space as a PDF file.
2. You and other logged-in users to export a single page, a page with its subpages, or an entire space as a PDF file.

**Permissions**

Admins and creators can enable and disable PDF export for a space.
{% endhint %}

## Export settings

To enable or disable PDF export, head to the settings for a space or collection. On the configure tab, you can enable or disable the PDF export setting. This setting determines whether or not **readers of your published content can download it in PDF format**.

## Export options

Regardless of the configured customization setting shown above, there are options for members of an organization on a Pro or Enterprise plan who are logged into the app to use the feature for spaces owned by an organization on a relevant plan. They will be able to export a page, page with its subpages, or an entire space as a PDF file.
