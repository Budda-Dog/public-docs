# Internationalization

GitBook supports the internationalization of a space or a collection, enabling public documentation user interface elements to be translated.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Permissions**

Administrators and Creators can change the language of the user interface for public documentation.
{% endhint %}

## Choosing a language for your content

The current supported languages are: English, French, Spanish, Chinese (simplified) and Japanese.

By default your content will have the **English** language selected. To customize this, you can access the presentation options in the **Customization** panel for the space or collection you wish to change.

### Inheriting language settings

If your space is inside a collection, you can set the localization language to 'Inherit' â€“ this will keep the space's localization language in sync with the setting at the collection level and can be overridden at the space-level at any time.

## Publishing your content in different languages

If you need to publish your documentation in multiple languages, you can use variants. Publishing a [collection as a variant](../getting-started/publishing/collection-publishing.md#collections-as-variants) lets you create a space per-language and publish the collection as unified UI, allowing readers to switch seamlessly between different language spaces.
