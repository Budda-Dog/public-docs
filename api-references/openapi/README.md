# OpenAPI

Manually writing REST API documentation can be a time-consuming process. Fortunately, GitBook streamlines this task by allowing you to import OpenAPI documents, which detail your API’s structure and functionality.

The OpenAPI Specification (OAS) is a framework that developers use to document REST APIs. Written in JSON or YAML, it outlines all your endpoints, parameters, schemas, and authentication schemes.

Once imported into GitBook, these documents are transformed into interactive and testable API blocks that visually represent your API methods—whether the specification is provided as a file or loaded from a URL.

GitBook supports [Swagger 2.0](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/2.0.md) or [OpenAPI 3.0](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.0.3.md) compliant files.

{% openapi src="https://petstore3.swagger.io/api/v3/openapi.json" path="/pet" method="post" %}
[https://petstore3.swagger.io/api/v3/openapi.json](https://petstore3.swagger.io/api/v3/openapi.json)
{% endopenapi %}

### Test it (powered by Scalar)

GitBook's OpenAPI block also supports a "test it" functionality, which allows your users to test your API methods with data and parameters filled in from the editor.

Powered by [Scalar](https://scalar.com/), you won't need to leave the docs in order to see your API methods in action. See and example of this above.

#### FAQ

<details>

<summary>Why isn’t my spec loading?</summary>

If you can’t fetch the spec, your API is likely blocking cross-origin requests (CORS).  Please check your API’s response headers for: [`Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Access-Control-Allow-Origin) . If your API only allows specific origins, ensure that `*.gitbook.io` is permitted.
