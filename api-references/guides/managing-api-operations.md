  Learn how to mark an OpenAPI API operation as experimental, deprecated or hide
  it from your documentation.

# Managing API operations

Itâ€™s common to have operations that are not fully stable yet or that need to be phased out. GitBook supports several OpenAPI extensions to help you manage these scenarios.

### Marking operation as experimental, alpha, or beta

Use `x-stability` to communicate that an endpoint is unstable or in progress. It helps users avoid non-production-ready endpoints. Supported values: `experimental`, `alpha`, `beta`.

<pre class="language-yaml" data-title="openapi.yaml"><code class="lang-yaml">paths:
  /pet:
    put:
      operationId: updatePet
<strong>      x-stability: experimental
</strong></code></pre>

### Deprecating an operation

To mark an operation as deprecated, add the `deprecated: true` attribute:

<pre class="language-yaml" data-title="openapi.yaml"><code class="lang-yaml">paths:
  /pet:
    put:
      operationId: updatePet
<strong>      deprecated: true
</strong></code></pre>

Optionally specify when support ends by including `x-deprecated-sunset`:

<pre class="language-yaml" data-title="openapi.yaml"><code class="lang-yaml">paths:
  /pet:
    put:
      operationId: updatePet
<strong>      deprecated: true
</strong><strong>      x-deprecated-sunset: 2030-12-05
</strong></code></pre>

### Hiding an operation from the API reference

To hide an operation from your API reference, add `x-internal: true` or `x-gitbook-ignore: true` attribute.

<pre class="language-yaml" data-title="openapi.yaml"><code class="lang-yaml">paths:
  /pet:
    put:
      operationId: updatePet
<strong>      x-internal: true
</strong></code></pre>
