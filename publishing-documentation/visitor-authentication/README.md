# Visitor authentication

{% include "../../.gitbook/includes/ultimate-hint.md" %}

Visitor authentication allows you to publish your content while requiring authentication from any visitors who want to view it. When enabled, GitBook lets your authentication provider handle who has access to the content.

### Use cases

Common use cases for visitor authentication include:

* Publishing sensitive product documentation that should only be accessible to paying customers, sales prospects or partners.
* Publishing internal knowledge base content that should only be accessible to employees of your company.

### How it works

There are two methods you can choose from when setting up visitor authentication:

1. Installing one of our authentication integrations — we currently support Okta, Azure, and Auth0. We **highly recommend** this option if you’re using an authentication provider we support.
2. Create and host your own server to handle the authentication. Many different technologies can be used, but it’s up to you to code and maintain the solution you choose.&#x20;
