GitBook Assistant gives your users fast, accurate answers about your documentation using natural language. It's personalized to your users, can be embedded into your website or product, and is available in the sidebar of your published docs.

Think of it as a product expert available to all of your users, in the places and times they need it most.

The Assistant uses agentic retrieval to understand the context of queries based on the user's current page, previously-read pages, and previous conversations.

### Extend GitBook Assistant with MCP servers

You can also add external data sources to GitBook Assistant to give it more context and data to pull answers from. You can do this by connecting Assistant to MCP servers for external platforms, such as:

* Your community (Slack, Discord, GitHub Communities etc)
* Support tools (Intercom etc)
* Your future product roadmap (GitHub, Linear etc)
* Docs for external integrations with products

To add an MCP server to GitBook Assistant, follow these steps:

{% step %}
**Open your site's settings**

{% step %}

At the bottom of the page is a table showing all the connected MCP servers. To add a new server, click **Add MCP server**

To add your server you'll need to give it a name, add the URL for the server, and configure the HTTP headers that will be sent along with the request to the server when a user submits a query.
