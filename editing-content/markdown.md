# Markdown

You can add rich-text to the editor, but also by using markdown.

Markdown is a popular markup syntax that's widely known for its simplicity and popularity on the Web. GitBook supports it as a keyboard-friendly way to write rich and structured text.

## Text formatting <a href="#text-formatting" id="text-formatting"></a>

We support all the classic inline Markdown formatting:

| Formatting    | Markdown version  | Result            |
| ------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| Bold          | `**bold**`        | **text**          |
| Italic        | `_italic_`        | _italic_          |
| Strikethrough | `~strikethrough~` | ~~strikethrough~~ |

## Titles

* Heading 1: `# A first-level title`
* Heading 2: `## A second-level title`
* Heading 3: `### A third-level title`

## Code blocks

\`\`\``⏎` creates a new code block.

\`\`\``py⏎` creates a new code block with Python syntax highlighting.

## Lists

We automatically detect ordered and un-ordered lists as you type.

* Begin a line with `-` or `*` to start a bullet list.
* Being a line with `1.` to start a numbered list. Use `Tab` to go one level deeper, and `Shift+Tab` to go up.
* Begin a line with `- [ ]` to start a task list.

## Quotes

Begin a line with `>` to create a block quote. If you select an entire paragraph from start to end, typing `>` will wrap the content in a block quote.
