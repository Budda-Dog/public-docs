# Content structure

## Table of Content

![](../.gitbook/assets/ToC.png)

Each space can contain as many pages as you need to write your documentation. All these pages are visible on the left side of your screen in the **table of content**.

From the Table of Content you can:

* Create new [pages](content-structure.md#pages)
* Create and manage [page groups](content-structure.md#groups)
* Add [external links](content-structure.md#external-links)
* [Import external docs](../features/import.md) like websites or Markdown files

## Structuring your content

![](<../.gitbook/assets/Page Menu.png>)

There are 3 different types of entries for the Table of Content.

### Initial Page <a href="initial-page" id="initial-page"></a>

The initial page is the homepage or the root of your documentation and basically works as the main node of all the pages of your documentation.

### Pages

A page has a title, an optional description, and a content area where you can write and add any kind of content.â€Œ

You can nest pages by dragging and dropping a page below an other in the table of contents.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Good to know: **There is no theoretical limit to page nesting. But we advise that you avoid adding more than 3 levels of nesting to avoid overly complex structures that might be overwhelming to navigate.
{% endhint %}

When you change the title of a page, the page's **slug** (the part at the very end of the URL, e.g. `/hello-world`) will automatically update, unless you've already manually set the page's slug.

You can change the title and the slug of a page anytime by clicking on the `...` button next to the page title in the table of content.

### Page groups <a href="groups" id="groups"></a>

Page groups are created to bring pages together and for you to create sections of pages dealing with similar subjects.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Good to know: **Groups can only live at the **top level of the table of content**. You cannot nest groups inside groups.
{% endhint %}

You can change the title and the slug of a group page anytime by clicking on the `...` button next to the group title in the Table of Content.

### External links <a href="external-links" id="external-links"></a>

These entries are external links and do not have any content in the editor. Their main function is to link to external sites or resources.
