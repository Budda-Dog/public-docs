# Editing pages

There are two ways you can edit content in GitBook, and they depend on the type of Space you're working on. For Spaces with Live Edit unlocked, you edit this by **starting to type.** For Spaces with Live Edits **locked,** you edit content through Change Requests.

Spaces with Live Edits enabled are great if you want to quickly get content together, either by yourself or with a team. Change Requests come in when you want or need the extra layer of workflow that branched content gives you.
