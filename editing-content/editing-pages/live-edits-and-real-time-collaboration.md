# Live edits and real-time collaboration

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Live Edit.png>)

**Live editing** is the default mode of any newly-created GitBook space. A space in Live Edit mode is editable instantly by anyone with the [correct permissions](../../collaboration/team-management/).

## Real-time collaboration

![](../../.gitbook/assets/RTC.png)

When a space's live edits are **unlocked**, you'll be able to see your team members who are currently participating in editing the space. There are two ways you can see who is currently working on the same space as you; firstly, by the avatars shown in the space's header; and secondly, by the live, real-time cursors that show the current position and selection of team members on the same page as you.

## Toggling Live Edit on or off

You can lock or unlock a Space for live edits at any time, by selecting 'Unlock live edits' and 'Lock live edits' from the Space's actions menu.
