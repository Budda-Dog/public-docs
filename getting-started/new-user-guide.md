GitBook provides all the essential tools to create amazing documentation right out of the box. However, there are a few key areas worth exploring to get started right away.

### Create your first site

We have an extensive guide on getting your first site up and running in GitBook. Head to our Quick start guide first to get your docs site published in minutes.

### Invite your team

Working in GitBook is always better with your team. Not only can you work synchronously with your team on editing pages, change requests, and more — But you can set advanced permissions for teammates and visitors when working across a larger organization. Head to our Account management docs to learn more.

{% endcontent-ref %}
