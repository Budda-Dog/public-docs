# Prerequisites

Before you can start using TPM, you need to ensure you have all the necessary requirements in place.

## Required Items

### 1. TPM or TPM+

You need access to either:
- **TPM**: The standard version of The Perfect Macro
- **TPM+**: The premium version with additional features

Contact the TPM team to get access to the bot software.

### 2. Minecraft Account

- A valid Minecraft account (Java Edition)
- The account should be able to access Hypixel SkyBlock
- For multiple accounts, you'll need multiple Minecraft accounts

### 3. Coflnet Account

- A Coflnet account at [sky.coflnet.com](https://sky.coflnet.com)
- Your Coflnet session password (for authentication)

### 4. Coflnet Premium Subscription

TPM requires a Coflnet subscription to function:
- **Cofl Premium**: Viable for basic flipping with premium exclusive filters
- **Cofl Premium+**: Recommended for full features and better flip opportunities

**Note**: Previously, only Premium+ was viable, but premium exclusive filters have been added, making Premium a viable option as well.

### 5. Discord Webhook (Recommended)

- A Discord webhook URL for notifications
- This allows you to receive real-time updates on purchases, sales, and profits
- Optional but highly recommended for monitoring your bot

## Version-Specific Requirements

### For Standard TPM

If you're using the standard TPM version, you will need:

- **VPS (Virtual Private Server)**
  - Recommended providers: Vultr or Linode
  - Minimum specs: 1GB RAM, 1 CPU core
  - Must run 24/7 for continuous flipping
  - Linux-based OS (Ubuntu recommended)

See the [VPS Setup Guide](../advanced/vps-setup.md) for detailed instructions on setting up your VPS.

### For TPM+

TPM+ may have different requirements or capabilities. Check the [TPM+ documentation](../tpm-plus/overview.md) for specific details.

## Configuration Requirements

### Config Access

You'll need access to a config file. Configs can be:
- **Free configs**: Available from the community
- **Paid configs**: Premium configurations optimized for specific strategies

Configs are loaded through the Cofl net panel at [sky.coflnet.com/flipper](https://sky.coflnet.com/flipper).

### Initial Purse

- It's recommended to have at least 10-50 million coins in your purse to start flipping
- Higher purse amounts allow for more valuable flips
- Your config should be adjusted based on your available purse

## Network Requirements

- Stable internet connection
- Low latency to Hypixel servers (important for bed spam and fast claiming)
- If using a VPS, ensure it's located in a region with good connectivity to Hypixel

## Getting Help

If you need assistance with any of the prerequisites:
- Contact TPM support through Discord
- Reach out to the config provider for config-specific questions
- Check the [Troubleshooting](../troubleshooting/common-issues.md) section

## Next Steps

Once you have all prerequisites ready:
