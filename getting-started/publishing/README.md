# Publishing

GitBook has different publishing options for you to choose from, depending on who you want to be able to access your content.

You can make your content completely [public](space-publishing.md#public-space) to anyone on the internet. Or, you can share more securely using [share links](share-links.md) or [visitor authentication](space-publishing.md#visitor-authentication).

You can also use collection publishing to [publish different versions of your documentation](collection-publishing.md#how-to-publish-a-collection-of-variants). For example, you might want to publish your documentation in different languages, or you might want to publish documentation for each version of your product.
