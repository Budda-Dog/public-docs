# Import

The import function allows you to migrate and unify existing documentation in GitBook. You can choose to import single or multiple pages although limits apply.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
**Permissions**

All members with Editor permission or above can use the import feature.
{% endhint %}

## Supported formats

GitBook supports imports from websites or files that are:

* Markdown (.md or .markdown)
* HTML (.html)
* Microsoft Word (.docx).

We also support import from:

* Confluence
* Notion
* GitHub Wiki
* Quip
* Dropbox Paper
* Google Docs

You can also upload a ZIP **** containing HTML or Markdown files when **importing multiple pages.**

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Note:** **This feature is in BETA**

Feel free to suggest import sources we don't support yet and [let us know](https://gitbook.canny.io/import) if you have any issues.
{% endhint %}

## Import panel

When you create a new space, you'll have the option to import content straight away:

![](<../.gitbook/assets/Blank Space.png>)

Import a page or subpage by selecting `Import Page` from the New Page menu, or `Import Subpage` in the page action menu, found in the table of contents:

![](<../.gitbook/assets/Page Menu.png>)

When you choose your input source, instructions will explain how to proceed.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Heads up!** Although GitBook supports importing content from different kinds of sources, the end result might be different from your source due to differences in product features and document format.
{% endhint %}

## Limits

GitBook currently has the following limits for imported content:

* The maximum number of pages that can be uploaded in a single import is **20.**
* The maximum number of files (images etc.) that can be uploaded in a single import is **20.**
