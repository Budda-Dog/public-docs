  more
---

# Importing content

You can migrate and unify existing documentation in GitBook using the import tool. You have the option to import single or multiple pages — or an entire Git repository.

#### Supported import formats

GitBook supports imports from websites or files in the following formats:

* Markdown (`.md` or `.markdown`)
* HTML (`.html`)
* Microsoft Word (`.docx`)

We also support imports from:

* Confluence
* Notion
* GitHub Wiki
* Quip
* Dropbox Paper
* Google Docs

If you want to **import multiple pages**, you can upload a ZIP file containing HTML or Markdown files.

#### The Import panel

When you create a new space, you’ll have the option to import content from the bottom sheet of the first empty page.

Alternatively, you can always import a page or subpage by selecting **New page** > **Import new pages** in the [table of contents](../resources/gitbook-ui.md#table-of-contents), or opening the Actions menu <picture><source srcset="../.gitbook/assets/actions - dark.svg" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img src="../.gitbook/assets/actions.svg" alt=""></picture> for a page and choosing **Import subpages**.

After choosing an input source, you can select the file you’d like to import.

{% hint style="warning" %}
GitBook imports content from various sources, but differences in product features and document formats may cause variations in the imported content compared to the original source.
{% endhint %}

#### Limitations

GitBook currently has the following limits for imported content:

* The maximum number of pages that can be uploaded in a single import is **20**.
* The maximum number of files (images etc.) that can be uploaded in a single import is **20**.
