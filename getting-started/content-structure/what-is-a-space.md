# What is a space?

![](../../.gitbook/assets/Space.png)

In GitBook, a space is a project where you can start organizing your ideas. Imagine it as a virtual book where you can start writing pages individually or collaborate asynchronously with your team members.&#x20;

## Create a space

To create a space click on the :heavy\_plus\_sign: button at the bottom of the sidebar.&#x20;

You can also create a space directly from your organization library or a collection screen using the 'New Space' button:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Collection (1).png>)

## Duplicate a space

To duplicate a space, select 'Duplicate' from the space's menu.

Duplicating a space will create a copy of the source space, in the same location (organization, collection, sub-collection, etc.) as the source space.

For example, duplicating a space called **Design System**, that lives in the Design collection, will be saved as **Copy of Design System**, inside the Design collection. Once duplicated you can edit the name as required.&#x20;

## Move a space

To move a space navigate to the space name in the sidebar, open the triple dot menu and select the 'Move space to...' command. Alternatively, simply drag and drop a space in the sidebar to reorder it. \

You can move spaces between collections or even organizations providing you have admin permissions in both.&#x20;

## Delete a space

You can delete your space from the space page by clicking the triple dot menu in the top right, and selecting 'Delete'. You will need to confirm the deletion in a popup.&#x20;

**Deleted spaces can be restored from trash for up to 7 days**.
