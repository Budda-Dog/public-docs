# What is a collection?

Collections are groups of spaces focused around a specific topic, team or purpose. You can think of them as a folder for your spaces.&#x20;

#### Aside from organizing your content, some of the key features of collections are:

* ability to manage permissions of spaces at scale allowing you to override the organization-level defaults (read more about that in [permissions](../../tour/member-management/permissions-and-inheritance.md))&#x20;
* ability to customize your collection and publish the spaces within it as variants (read more about that in [collection publishing](../publishing/collection-publishing.md))

## Create a collection

You can create a collection directly in the sidebar:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/New Space.png>)

Or, in the collection view, by hitting the 'New Collection' button:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Collection (1).png>)

## Move a collection

Simply drag and drop a collection in the sidebar to reorder it. Drop it onto another collection to nest it inside, or drop it from your Personal library into your Organization library (or vice-versa) to move it between libraries.

If you can't, or prefer not to, drag and drop, you can also move a collection by selecting the 'Move to…' command in the collection's menu:

## Nest collections

Collections can be nested inside each other, creating a collection -> sub-collection -> space hierarchy. Either drag or drop a collection into another, or nest it by using the 'Move to…' command on the collection you want to move.

## Delete a collection

Select 'Delete' from the collection's menu to delete the collection.

**Deleting a collection is final**, but spaces inside a deleted collection will be moved to 'Trash' and can be restored up to 7 days after deletion.
