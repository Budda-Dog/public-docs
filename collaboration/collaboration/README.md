# Collaboration

GitBook is designed for easy asynchronous collaboration. You can [invite members](../../account-management/member-management/invite-members-to-your-organization.md) to your GitBook organization, and each member can then contribute based upon their [role](../../account-management/member-management/roles.md).

Contributions can be made using [live edits](live-edits.md) in some cases, or using [change requests](change-requests.md) for even greater control over your workflow.

[Teams](../../account-management/member-management/teams.md) can collaborate and review the content using [comments and discussions](../comments-discussion.md).

{% hint style="info" %}
**Permissions:**\
Collaboration settings are available to administrators and creators at the content level. Commenting is accessible to everyone except readers and guests.
