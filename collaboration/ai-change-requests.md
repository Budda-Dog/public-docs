# AI change requests

### Overview

The **AI Change Requests** feature brings the capabilities of GitBook AI to one of the core functionalities of GitBook: Change Requests. This feature streamlines the process of proposing, planning, and implementing changes to your GitBook content by leveraging AI assistance.

With AI Change Requests, you can:

* **Start a new Change Request**: Describe the modifications you want to make, and GitBook AI will draft a plan for review.
* **Refine and approve the plan**: Review and adjust the AI-generated proposal as needed.
* **Execute the changes**: Once finalized, GitBook AI will apply the changes directly to your content.

### How It Works

1. **Initiate a Change Request**
   * Open GitBook and navigate to the Change Requests section.
   * Start a new Change Request and describe the desired changes. Examples of requests include:
     * "Find and replace any instances of \[feature name] with \[updated feature name]."
     * "Correct typos on the Welcome page."
     * "Reformat the \[product feature] page into three sections: Overview, Installation, and FAQ."
     * "Add a new page for \[product feature] and document it based on this description: \[product description]."
2. **Review and Tweak the AI-Generated Plan**
   * GitBook AI will draft a proposed plan based on your description.
   * You can review, edit, and refine the draft to ensure it aligns with your vision.
3. **Execute the Plan**
   * Approve the final plan to allow GitBook AI to apply the requested changes directly to your project.

### Example Use Cases

* **Content Updates**: Quickly update outdated terminology or features across multiple pages.
* **Error Correction**: Automatically detect and fix typos or grammatical errors in your documentation.
* **Page Reorganization**: Restructure content into clear and logical sections.
* **New Content Creation**: Generate new pages or sections based on high-level descriptions.

### Current Limitations

While the AI Change Requests feature is still in Alpha, there are some known limitations:

* **GitBook-specific blocks**: Updates to these blocks are not yet supported.
