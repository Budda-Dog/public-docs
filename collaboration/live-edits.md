# Live edits

**Live editing** is the default editing mode for any newly-created GitBook space.

With live editing enabled, you can see the avatars of anyone currently viewing the space in the top-right corner.&#x20;

GitBook supports live collaboration, meaning you’ll be able to work on the same document with multiple members at the same time.

### Toggling live edit mode

You can toggle live edit mode in a space by selecting **Lock live edits** or **Unlock live edits** from the space’s **Action menu** <picture><source srcset="../.gitbook/assets/actions - dark.svg" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img src="../.gitbook/assets/actions.svg" alt=""></picture>.

### When is live editing _not_ available?

You cannot unlock live editing if:

1. a space is published with the **In collection**, **Public**, or **Unlisted** visibility option. We know this is a limitation, and we hope to change this in the future.
2. a space has [GitHub or GitLab Sync](../getting-started/git-sync/) enabled.

{% hint style="info" %}
Only [administrators and creators](../account-management/member-management/roles.md) can lock or unlock live edits.
{% endhint %}
