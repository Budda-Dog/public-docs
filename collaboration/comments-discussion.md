# Comments and discussions

Comments in GitBook allow you to have as much (or as little) conversation as you like around specific pieces of content â€” without switching over to a workplace chat tool or 'jumping on a call'!

## Comment within your content <a href="#comment-within-your-content" id="comment-within-your-content"></a>

You can comment on any block within your content. The comment will be displayed in a right hand panel which you can open by clicking on the <img src="../.gitbook/assets/comments_icon" alt="" data-size="line">icon in the sub-navigation.&#x20;

The first asks for more detail to be included in the section, the second confirms that they will work on the changes."><figcaption><p>Commenting on a specific content block </p></figcaption></figure>

### Comment threads

Any top-level comment in GitBook can be replied to, turning it into a discussion thread.

## Resolving comments

Commenting and discussions can get messy, especially with larger teams! To reduce the noise, you can **resolve** a comment at any time. Resolving a comment will hide it in the interface, but still keep it accessible in the 'Resolved' tab of the space's comments sidesheet.

## Reacting to comments

You can also leave an emoji reaction on any comment.

## Commenting and change requests

With commenting being integral to feedback, you might want to read more about how comments and change requests work together:

{% endcontent-ref %}
