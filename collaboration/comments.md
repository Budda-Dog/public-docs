# Comments

Comments allow you to provide feedback around specific pieces of content — without switching out of context from GitBook.

### Add a comment <a href="#comment-within-your-content" id="comment-within-your-content"></a>

You can open the comments panel by clicking on the **Comments** button <picture><source srcset="../.gitbook/assets/comment_icon_dark.svg" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img src="../.gitbook/assets/comment_icon_light.svg" alt=""></picture> in the [space header](../resources/gitbook-ui.md#space-header).

Adding a comment here will attach a comment to the entire page. You can also comment on a specific block by hovering over a block and clicking the content icon that appears on the right.

You can tag teammates by typing the `@` symbol followed by their name.

### Comment threads

You can reply to any comment to start a conversation with your teammates, turning it into a discussion thread.

You can also leave an emoji reaction on any comment by clicking the emoji button on the message or thread you’d like to react to.

### Resolving comments

If you’re done working through a comment thread or idea, you can **resolve** a comment at any time. Resolving a comment will hide it in the interface, but still keep it accessible in the ’Resolved’ tab of the space’s comments section.
