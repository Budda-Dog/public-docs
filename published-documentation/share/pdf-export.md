# PDF export

{% hint style="info" %}
This feature is available on our **Pro** and **Enterprise** plans.
{% endhint %}

PDF export allows visitors and logged-in users to download your published content or individual pages as a PDF file.

### Allow readers to export a PDF version of your content

{% hint style="info" %}
**Permissions**

Admins and creators can enable and disable PDF export for a space.
{% endhint %}

To enable or disable PDF export for your readers, head to the customization settings for a space or collection. On the configure tab, you can enable or disable the PDF export setting. This setting determines whether or not **readers of your published content can download it in PDF format**.
