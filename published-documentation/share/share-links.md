# Share privately with secret links

{% hint style="info" %}
This feature is available on our **Pro** and **Enterprise** plans.
{% endhint %}

You can share you content privately with customers or partners without needing to invite them to our organization by using secret links.

### Publish with share links

To publish with share link(s), open the space or collection you want to share in GitBook. Open the share menu and select **share to an audience**.

Next, click on **publish with share links** to access your share links. Youâ€™ll be able to review and name your share links, customize the UR and copy the links.&#x20;

Once the link is active, a private token is generated within your URL, which is unique to your space. Sharing this link will give non-GitBook users access to your private content in read mode only.

{% hint style="info" %}
Share links can be [revoked](share-links.md#revoke-a-link) and regenerated at any time.
{% endhint %}

### Permissions

The content will be accessible to **anyone following the link**. Your team members will always be able to access your content from their dashboard.

### Revoke a link

The shareable link can be disabled or regenerated by revoking a link. You can see and revoke any previously generated link by opening the visibility menu and clicking through to link and domain settings. Once a link is revoked, anyone with a previous link to your content will no longer have access.
