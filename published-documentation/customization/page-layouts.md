# Page options & covers

You can find the links to set page options and page covers by hovering over the page title. You’ll see the links appear just above the page title.

### Page options

Page options allow you to select how each page is displayed to those who visit your _published_ content. There are three layout presets to choose from, or you can create a custom layout.

Each layout preset will toggle on or off each of the following parts of the page:

- Page title
- Page description
- Table of contents
- Page outline
- Next/previous links

Take a look at how each preset will set each of these parts of the page:

<table data-full-width="true"><thead><tr><th>Part of the page</th><th data-type="checkbox">Docs layout</th><th data-type="checkbox">Editorial layout</th><th data-type="checkbox">Landing page layout</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Page title</td><td>true</td><td>true</td><td>true</td></tr><tr><td>Page description</td><td>true</td><td>true</td><td>true</td></tr><tr><td>Table of contents</td><td>true</td><td>false</td><td>false</td></tr><tr><td>Page outline</td><td>true</td><td>true</td><td>false</td></tr><tr><td>Next/previous links</td><td>true</td><td>true</td><td>true</td></tr></tbody></table>

If you want to use a custom layout, you can choose the custom option and then start toggling the settings on and off — or, you can simply toggle a setting while another layout is chosen and we’ll automatically switch to custom for you.

Remember that the settings you choose here will affect the **published content**.

### Page covers

You can also set a page cover for each page of your documentation. When you click the page cover link, a cover will be added immediately. From there, you can:

- **Change the cover image**

  Click the button that appears on the cover when you hover over it, and choose or upload an image. Based on how we currently display the page cover, 1990x480 pixels is the ideal size.

- **Reposition the cover image**

  Click the three-dot icon that appears on the cover when you hover over it, click reposition, then drag the image as you wish and click save.

- **Remove the cover image**\
  Click the three-dot icon that appears on the cover when you hover over it and then click remove.
