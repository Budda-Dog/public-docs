# Troubleshooting

## "Domain already connected" error

This error can be returned when setting up a custom domain.

It happens when the domain you tried to set up is already connected to a different content (another Space, Collection or Organization).

In this case, you need to:

* either use a different domain to connect to your content,
* or first disconnect the domain from the content it's already connected to before you can reconnect it to the content you initially tried to connect the domain to.

The error displayed should include a link to access the content that is already connected to the domain.

Click the link to access the content to help you decide.

{% hint style="warning" %}
You may not have access to the connected content.

If that's the case [contact the Support team](../troubleshooting/support.md) so they can help you out.
