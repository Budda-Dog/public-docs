# Security FAQs

## Where and how is my data stored?

All user data and content is stored in the US on [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com), which is backed by the same infrastructure and security that Google uses for its own services.

Customer data is stored in U.S. data centers. Some data (HTML pages & assets) may be cached in other geographies by our CDN. Access to private content through our CDN is always validated through our application servers using a complex permissions system.

Google follows or even leads most of the industry's best practices and is compliant with most major security [standards and certifications](https://cloud.google.com/security/compliance/).

## **Is GitBook SOC 2 certified?**

Yes. You can read more about it [here](https://policies.gitbook.com/privacy-and-security/security/security-as-a-company-value#soc-2-type-2). Customers and prospects can request access to the audit report by reaching out to our sales team (sales@gitbook.io).
